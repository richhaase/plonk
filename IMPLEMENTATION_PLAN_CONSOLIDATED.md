# Plonk Implementation Plan (Revised)

*Last Updated: 2025-01-14*

## Overview

This document outlines the revised implementation plan for the plonk codebase. Given that the project is only 8 days old, we're removing premature optimization work and focusing on high-value improvements that directly benefit users.

## Revised Strategy

**Key Change**: Removing interface consolidation and architectural refactoring work that's premature for such a young project. The codebase needs time to stabilize before major architectural changes.

## Immediate Priority (This Week)

### 1. Remove RuntimeState Pattern
**Context**: RuntimeState is barely used while SharedContext is widely adopted (10+ commands). This is a simple, high-value cleanup.

**Actions**:
- [ ] Analyze overlap between RuntimeState and SharedContext
- [ ] Remove `RuntimeState` struct and all references
- [ ] Enhance SharedContext with any missing functionality from RuntimeState
- [ ] Update all remaining commands to use SharedContext consistently

**Code Locations**:
- `internal/state/runtime_state.go` - Remove entirely
- `internal/runtime/context.go` - Enhance as needed
- Commands still using RuntimeState: `dot_remove.go` (search for TODOs)

## Future Considerations (After Project Stabilizes)

### When APIs Naturally Stabilize (3-6 months)
- Revisit interface consolidation if duplicate interfaces become a maintenance burden
- Consider service layer extraction if `shared.go` continues to grow
- Standardize error handling patterns based on real usage patterns

### Focus Areas Instead
1. **Feature Development**: Build user-requested features
2. **User Feedback**: Gather real-world usage patterns
3. **Bug Fixes**: Address issues as they arise
4. **Documentation**: Improve user-facing documentation

## Deferred Work (Moved from Original Plan)

### Phase 1: Interface Consolidation
**Status**: Paused at 83% complete
**Reasoning**: Too early for major refactoring. APIs need time to stabilize naturally.

### Phase 3: Extract Service Layer
**Status**: Deferred
**Reasoning**: `shared.go` complexity is manageable for now. Revisit if it grows significantly.

### Phase 4: Standardize Error Handling
**Status**: Deferred
**Reasoning**: Current error handling works. Wait for real usage patterns before standardizing.

### Phase 5: Legacy Cleanup
**Status**: Deferred
**Reasoning**: Minor inconsistencies aren't impacting development velocity yet.

## Key Learnings

### Adapter Pattern Discovery
During the brief Phase 1 work, we discovered that adapters are essential for preventing circular dependencies, not technical debt. This learning is valuable and should be retained in documentation. See [ADAPTER_ARCHITECTURE.md](ADAPTER_ARCHITECTURE.md) for guidelines.

## Notes for Development

- Always check [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for coding guidelines
- Update [DEVELOPMENT_HISTORY.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT_HISTORY.md) when completing work
- Use pre-commit hooks: `just precommit`
- Focus on user value over architectural perfection
