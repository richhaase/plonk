# Contributing to Plonk

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Plonk! This guide covers the development workflow and standards for both human contributors and AI coding agents.

## Development Philosophy

Plonk follows a strict **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** approach. This ensures code quality, maintainability, and reliable functionality across all components.

## Required Development Workflow

All contributions MUST follow this TDD pattern:

### 1. üî¥ RED Phase
Write failing tests first. This ensures you understand the requirements before implementation.

### 2. üü¢ GREEN Phase  
Write the minimal code necessary to make the tests pass. Resist the urge to add extra functionality.

### 3. üîµ REFACTOR Phase
Improve the code while keeping all tests green. This is where you enhance readability and performance.

### 4. üìù COMMIT Phase
Commit your changes with clear, descriptive messages following the project conventions.

### 5. üìö UPDATE Phase
Update relevant documentation:
- For humans: Update README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, or other user-facing docs
- For AI agents: Update CLAUDE.md with implementation details
- For active work: Update TODO.md to reflect completed tasks

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.24.4 or later
- ASDF for tool version management (optional but recommended)
- Git for version control

### Development Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd plonk

# Install development tools (if using ASDF)
asdf install

# Build the project
just build

# Run tests
just test

# Run the full development cycle
just dev
```

### Installing from Source

If you want to install plonk locally for development or testing:

```bash
# Option 1: Install to GOBIN (recommended for development)
just install

# Option 2: Install globally using go install
go install ./cmd/plonk

# Option 3: Manual installation
just build
cp build/plonk /usr/local/bin/plonk  # or any directory in your PATH

# Verify installation
plonk --help
which plonk
```

**Notes:**
- `just install` builds the binary to `build/plonk` then copies it to `$(go env GOBIN)`
- Make sure `$(go env GOBIN)` is in your PATH (or `$(go env GOPATH)/bin` if GOBIN is unset)
- For ASDF users, GOBIN should already be configured correctly
- The binary will be named `plonk` and available globally after installation

## Making Changes

### Before Starting
1. Check TODO.md for active work items
2. Review ROADMAP.md for planned features
3. Ensure your change aligns with project goals

### Code Standards
- Follow Go idioms and best practices
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and testable
- Maintain consistent error handling patterns

### Testing Requirements
- All new features must have comprehensive tests
- Use table-driven tests where appropriate
- Mock external dependencies (don't execute real commands in tests)
- Aim for high test coverage

### Documentation
- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Update relevant documentation files
- Include examples in function documentation
- Keep CHANGELOG.md updated for significant changes

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Follow the TDD workflow for all changes
4. Ensure all tests pass (`just test`)
5. Run the full CI pipeline locally (`just ci`)
6. Commit with clear messages
7. Push to your fork
8. Open a Pull Request with:
   - Clear description of changes
   - Link to related issues
   - Test coverage information
   - Documentation updates

### Commit Message Format
```
<type>: <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore

## Working with AI Agents

If you're an AI coding agent:
1. Always read CLAUDE.md for project-specific guidance
2. Sync with TODO.md at the start of each session
3. Follow the TDD workflow strictly
4. Update TODO.md as you complete tasks
5. Refer to established patterns in the codebase

## Code Review Criteria

PRs will be reviewed for:
- [ ] Adherence to TDD workflow
- [ ] Test coverage and quality
- [ ] Code clarity and maintainability
- [ ] Consistent error handling
- [ ] Documentation completeness
- [ ] Performance considerations

## Getting Help

- Review existing code for patterns and examples
- Check ARCHITECTURE.md for system design decisions
- Consult CODEBASE_MAP.md for navigation help
- Open an issue for questions or clarifications

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the same license as the project.

Remember: **Quality over quantity**. A well-tested, clearly written small change is better than a large, untested addition.
