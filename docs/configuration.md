# Plonk Configuration

This is the comprehensive guide to configuring plonk. Plonk uses two configuration files located in `~/.config/plonk/`:

## Table of Contents

- [Lock File (plonk.lock)](#lock-file-plonklock)
- [Filesystem as State](#filesystem-as-state)
- [Configuration File (plonk.yaml)](#configuration-file-plonkyaml)
- [Basic Configuration](#basic-configuration)
- [Dotfile Configuration](#dotfile-configuration)
- [Timeout Configuration](#timeout-configuration)
- [Diff Tool Configuration](#diff-tool-configuration)
- [Advanced Configuration](#advanced-configuration)
- [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)
- [Configuration Precedence](#configuration-precedence)
- [Common Configuration Scenarios](#common-configuration-scenarios)

## Lock File (plonk.lock)

The lock file is automatically maintained by plonk and tracks your managed resources. Do not edit this file manually.

**Format (v3):**

```yaml
version: 3
packages:
  brew:
    - ripgrep
    - fd
    - bat
  cargo:
    - tokei
  go:
    - gopls
  pnpm:
    - typescript
  uv:
    - ruff
```

The v3 format groups packages by manager for clarity and efficiency.

**Note:** Dotfiles are not tracked in the lock file. Instead, the filesystem structure of `$PLONK_DIR` itself represents the dotfile state (see [Filesystem as State](#filesystem-as-state)).

## Filesystem as State

Plonk uses the filesystem structure of `$PLONK_DIR` to represent dotfile state. The contents of this directory define what dotfiles are managed:

```
$PLONK_DIR/
├── plonk.yaml        # Configuration (not a dotfile)
├── plonk.lock        # Package state (not a dotfile)
├── zshrc             # Deployed to ~/.zshrc
├── gitconfig         # Deployed to ~/.gitconfig
└── config/
    └── nvim/
        └── init.lua  # Deployed to ~/.config/nvim/init.lua
```

This approach provides several benefits:

- No separate tracking file needed for dotfiles
- Easy to see what's managed by examining the directory
- Git-native workflow (the directory is your repository)
- Impossible for tracking and filesystem to get out of sync

**Always Excluded**:

- `plonk.yaml` and `plonk.lock` - Configuration and package state files
- `.plonk/` directory - Reserved for future plonk metadata (templates, etc.)

## Configuration File (plonk.yaml)

User configuration file for customizing plonk behavior. This file is optional - plonk works with sensible defaults.

## Basic Configuration

### Package Manager Settings

```yaml
# Default package manager (used for dotfile discovery, not package tracking)
default_manager: brew # Options: brew, cargo, go, pnpm, uv

# Note: Package tracking always requires explicit manager:package format
# e.g., plonk track brew:ripgrep cargo:bat
```

## Dotfile Configuration

### Ignore Patterns

Control which files are excluded when scanning for dotfiles:

```yaml
# Note: ignore_patterns should be at the root level, not under dotfiles
ignore_patterns:
  # Temporary files
  - "*.swp"
  - "*.tmp"
  - "*.bak"
  - "*~"

  # OS-specific files
  - ".DS_Store" # macOS
  - "Thumbs.db" # Windows
  - ".Trash"

  # Cache and build directories
  - ".cache/*"
  - "node_modules/*"
  - "target/*" # Rust build output
  - "__pycache__/*" # Python cache

  # Version control
  - ".git/*"
  - ".svn/*"

  # IDE/Editor files
  - ".vscode/*"
  - ".idea/*"
  - "*.log"

# Dotfile-specific configuration (optional)
dotfiles:
  unmanaged_filters: # Filters for marking dotfiles as unmanaged
    - "*.backup"
    - "*.old"

`ignore_patterns` uses the same syntax as `.gitignore`, so you can rely on features like leading `/` for root-only matches, `**` globstars, directory-only entries with a trailing `/`, and negation with `!`. Patterns are evaluated relative to your home directory when scanning for unmanaged files and relative to the plonk config directory when reading managed dotfiles.
```

### Directory Expansion

Specify directories to recursively scan for dotfiles:

```yaml
# Note: expand_directories should be at the root level, not under dotfiles
expand_directories:
  - ".config" # Standard config location (relative to home)
  # Default is just .config, add more as needed:
  # - ".local/share"    # User data files
  # - ".ssh"            # SSH configuration
```

## Timeout Configuration

### Operation Timeouts

Control how long operations wait before timing out:

```yaml
# All timeouts in seconds
package_timeout: 180 # Package install/uninstall (3 minutes default)
operation_timeout: 300 # General operations (5 minutes default)
dotfile_timeout: 60 # Dotfile operations (1 minute default)

# Examples for different scenarios:
# Fast network, powerful machine:
# package_timeout: 120    # 2 minutes
# operation_timeout: 60   # 1 minute

# Slow network, limited resources:
# package_timeout: 600    # 10 minutes
# operation_timeout: 600  # 10 minutes
```

## Diff Tool Configuration

### Custom Diff Tool

Configure which tool is used to display differences for drifted dotfiles:

```yaml
# Default: git diff --no-index (zero-config)
diff_tool: "delta"
# Other examples:
# diff_tool: "vimdiff"              # Vim's diff mode
# diff_tool: "code --diff --wait"   # VS Code diff
# diff_tool: "meld"                 # GUI diff tool
# diff_tool: "colordiff"            # Colorized diff
```

The diff tool is executed as: `{tool} {source_path} {deployed_path}`

## Advanced Configuration

### Complete Real-World Example

A comprehensive configuration for a development environment:

```yaml
# Package management
default_manager: brew

# Dotfile management
ignore_patterns:
  - "*.swp"
  - "*.tmp"
  - ".DS_Store"
  - ".cache/*"
  - "node_modules/*"
  - ".git/*"
expand_directories:
  - ".config"
  - ".local/share"

# Optional dotfile-specific configuration
dotfiles:
  unmanaged_filters:
    - "*.backup"

# Conservative timeouts for reliability
package_timeout: 600 # 10 minutes for large packages
operation_timeout: 600 # 10 minutes for searches
dotfile_timeout: 120 # 2 minutes for file operations

# Diff tool for viewing drift
diff_tool: "delta" # Use delta for syntax-highlighted diffs
```

## Environment Variables

- `PLONK_DIR` - Override config directory location (default: `~/.config/plonk`)
- `VISUAL` - Primary editor for `plonk config edit` command
- `EDITOR` - Fallback editor if VISUAL not set
- `NO_COLOR` - Disable colored output when set to any value

## Configuration Precedence

Settings are applied in the following order (highest to lowest priority):

1. **Command-line flags** - Direct flags like `--dry-run`, `--packages`
2. **Environment variables** - `PLONK_DIR`, `EDITOR`, etc.
3. **Configuration file** - Settings in `plonk.yaml`
4. **Built-in defaults** - Plonk's default values

Example: Package tracking always requires the `manager:package` format, e.g., `plonk track brew:wget`.

## Common Configuration Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Rust-Focused Development

For Rust-heavy workflows:

```yaml
default_manager: cargo
package_timeout: 300 # Cargo builds can take time
operation_timeout: 180
```

### Scenario 2: Minimal Dotfile Management

For users who only want basic dotfile tracking:

```yaml
ignore_patterns:
  - "*" # Ignore everything by default
# Manually add only specific files with `plonk add`
```

### Scenario 3: Multi-Language Development

For polyglot developers:

```yaml
default_manager: brew # System tools via Homebrew
expand_directories:
  - ".config"
  - ".local/share"
  - ".cargo" # Rust configuration
```

## Creating and Managing Configuration

```bash
# View current configuration (including defaults)
plonk config show

# Create and edit configuration file
plonk config edit

# View configuration with different output formats
plonk config show --output yaml
plonk config show --output json
```

## Viewing Configuration

The `plonk config show` command displays your effective configuration with user-defined values highlighted:

```bash
# Show configuration with (user-defined) annotations in blue
plonk config show

# Output in JSON format (clean, no annotations)
plonk config show -o json
```

This makes it easy to see at a glance which settings you've customized versus which are using defaults.

## Configuration Editing

The `plonk config edit` command provides a visudo-style editing experience:

1. **Full Runtime View**: Shows all available configuration options with their current values (defaults + your overrides)
2. **User-Defined Annotations**: Values you've customized are marked with `# (user-defined)` comments
3. **Validation Loop**: If you save invalid configuration, you'll get options to:
   - (e)dit again to fix errors
   - (r)evert changes and exit
   - (q)uit without saving
4. **Minimal Saving**: Only values that differ from defaults are written to `plonk.yaml`

This approach keeps your configuration file clean and makes it immediately clear what you've customized.

### Example Edit Session

When you run `plonk config edit`, you'll see something like:

```yaml
# Plonk Configuration Editor
# - Delete any line to revert to default
# - Only values different from defaults will be saved to plonk.yaml
# - Save and exit to apply, or exit without saving to cancel

default_manager: brew
operation_timeout: 300
package_timeout: 600 # (user-defined)
dotfile_timeout: 60

expand_directories:
  - .config
  - .ssh # (user-defined)

ignore_patterns:
  - .DS_Store
  - .Trash
  - "*.swp" # (user-defined)
```

In this example, only `package_timeout`, the additional `.ssh` entry in `expand_directories`, and the additional `*.swp` pattern in `ignore_patterns` would be saved to plonk.yaml.
