# Why Plonk?

tldr:  There are a ton of great dotfile managers out there, and many great
package managers.  None of them did it all for me, and made it easy.  The
goal of plonk is to make setting up a new computer/vm as my ideal develoment
environment in minutes.  And, since I'm a shell environment tinkerer, I need
to be able to change what plonk knows about.

# Goals

* one command dev environment setup.
* dev environment management configs/packages, ai-labs in future
* idiomatic and simple go code
* fluent simple ui. do just enough, not more.
* make my life and the lives of future project users easier
