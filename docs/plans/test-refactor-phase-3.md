# Testability Refactor: Phase 3

Status: Completed (2025-09-25)

## Goal

Introduce a minimal filesystem seam for dotfiles to enable hermetic tests where needed.

## Delivered Changes

- Added `FileWriter` interface implemented by `AtomicFileWriter`.
- Updated `FileOperations` to depend on `FileWriter` and added `NewFileOperationsWithWriter` for dependency injection.
- No behavior changes; existing code uses `AtomicFileWriter` by default.

## Validation

- Full unit test suite passes with no regressions.
