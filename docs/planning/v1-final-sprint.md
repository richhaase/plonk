# V1.0 Final Sprint Action Plan

## Current Status (2025-07-31)

**Completed**: All critical features and bug fixes
**Remaining**: Quality assurance and release preparation tasks
**Target**: v1.0.0 release

## Setup Philosophy Change

Plonk now assumes Homebrew is installed as a prerequisite. This simplifies our architecture and aligns with developer expectations:

**New Setup Flow**:
1. Install Homebrew (one-time, per machine)
2. Install plonk via `brew install plonk` (once Homebrew formula is available)
3. Either `plonk clone user/dotfiles` or just start using plonk

This removes complexity while maintaining the "zero-config" philosophy.

## Remaining Tasks

### 1. Comprehensive Test Review (1-2 days)

**Purpose**: Ensure test quality and coverage before v1.0

**Scope**:
- **Unit Tests**: Verify NO external calls, proper mocking
- **Integration Tests**: Review coverage of system interactions
- **BATS Tests**: Validate behavioral test completeness

**Key Questions**:
- Are unit tests truly isolated?
- What's our test coverage percentage?
- Are there critical paths without tests?
- Can we improve test organization or clarity?

**Deliverables**:
- Test coverage report
- List of tests that need fixing
- Recommendations for improvement

### 2. Code Complexity Review (1-2 days)

**Purpose**: Identify and reduce unnecessary complexity introduced during revisions

**Focus Areas**:
- Functions that have grown too large
- Duplicated logic that could be extracted
- Complex conditionals that could be simplified
- Error handling patterns that could be standardized

**Deliverables**:
- List of complexity hotspots
- Refactoring recommendations
- Any critical refactoring for v1.0

### 3. Critical Documentation Review (1 day)

**Purpose**: Ensure documentation is accurate, complete, and user-friendly

**Scope**:
- README.md accuracy and completeness
- Command documentation review
- Installation guide clarity
- Examples and tutorials
- API documentation (for library users)

**Key Questions**:
- What's missing that users need?
- What's outdated or incorrect?
- What's redundant and can be removed?
- Are examples clear and working?

**Deliverables**:
- Documentation gap analysis
- List of required updates
- Cleanup recommendations

### 4. Justfile and GitHub Actions Review (1 day)

**Purpose**: Ensure build system and CI/CD are robust for v1.0

**Justfile Review**:
- Are all recipes still relevant and working?
- Is the version management correct?
- Are there missing helpful recipes?
- Is the release process well-defined?

**GitHub Actions Review**:
- Is CI comprehensive enough?
- Are we testing on all target platforms?
- Is the release workflow ready for v1.0?
- Are there security concerns?

**Deliverables**:
- List of improvements needed
- Any critical fixes for v1.0
- Documentation of release process

### 5. Linux Platform Testing (COMPLETED)

**Test Environments**:
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (via Lima VM)
- Debian 12 (via Lima VM)
- WSL2 on Windows (Ubuntu)

**Test Plan**: See [linux-homebrew-testing-plan.md](linux-homebrew-testing-plan.md)

**Key Validation Points**:
1. Document Homebrew installation process on Linux
2. All package managers work (brew, npm, cargo, pip, gem, go)
3. Dotfile management works identically
4. `plonk clone` full journey succeeds
5. Output formatting consistent with macOS

**Deliverables**:
- Test execution logs
- Bug fixes (if any)
- Linux-specific documentation updates

### 6. Documentation Updates & Release Prep (1-2 days)

**Critical Updates**:
- [ ] Remove stability warning from README
- [ ] Update version to 1.0.0 in main.go
- [ ] Create v1.0.0 release notes
- [ ] Review all command documentation for accuracy
- [ ] Ensure installation guide is current

**Version Update Locations**:
- `cmd/plonk/main.go` - change `version = "dev"` to `version = "v1.0.0"`
- Tag commit with `v1.0.0`
- GitHub release with binaries

**Release Notes Template**:
```markdown
# Plonk v1.0.0 - Stable Release

The unified package and dotfile manager is ready for production use!

## Highlights
- üéØ One command setup: `plonk clone user/dotfiles`
- üì¶ Unified management of packages and dotfiles
- üîÑ Drift detection shows when configs have changed
- üåç Cross-platform support (macOS, Linux, WSL)
- üöÄ Progress indicators for long operations

## Prerequisites
- Homebrew (install from https://brew.sh)
- Git

## Installation
```bash
# Via Homebrew (coming soon)
brew install plonk

# Via Go
go install github.com/richhaase/plonk/cmd/plonk@v1.0.0
```

## Quick Start
```bash
# Clone existing dotfiles
plonk clone user/dotfiles

# Or just start using plonk
plonk add ~/.zshrc
plonk install ripgrep
```

## Stability Commitment
Core commands and behaviors are now stable. Future changes will maintain backwards compatibility.
```

## Success Criteria

v1.0 ships when:
- [x] All critical features work reliably
- [x] Linux testing shows parity with macOS (with bugs documented)
- [x] Critical bugs fixed (ALL COMPLETED 2025-07-31)
- [ ] Documentation reflects current behavior
- [ ] Version updated to 1.0.0
- [ ] Release notes explain stability
- [ ] Tagged and released on GitHub

## All Critical Bugs Fixed (2025-07-31)

All critical bugs have been resolved:
1. ‚úÖ Apply now restores drifted files
2. ‚úÖ Info shows correct management status
3. ‚úÖ SOURCE column displays correctly
4. ‚úÖ Apply shows progress indicators
5. ‚úÖ Apply error messages improved
6. ‚úÖ Doctor Homebrew path fixed on Linux
7. ‚úÖ Permission errors handled gracefully
8. ‚úÖ config/test/ path reconciliation fixed
9. ‚úÖ Non-functional --force flags removed
10. ‚úÖ Error messages show actual package manager output
11. ‚úÖ Usage no longer displayed on errors

See [v1-bugs-found.md](v1-bugs-found.md) for details.

## Implications of Homebrew Prerequisite

This simplification has several benefits:
1. **Removes complexity** - No need for plonk to manage Homebrew installation
2. **Cleaner error messages** - "Homebrew not found" vs complex installation failures
3. **Better user experience** - Homebrew's installer handles PATH setup correctly
4. **Simplifies doctor --fix** - May only need to install language package managers

### Completed for v1.0:
- ‚úÖ Removed `doctor --fix` entirely - doctor is now a pure diagnostic tool
- ‚úÖ Only `plonk clone` installs package managers (when needed for the repository)
- ‚úÖ Updated all documentation to reflect Homebrew as prerequisite

## Not Blocking v1.0

These can wait:
- Additional package manager support
- Performance optimizations
- Verbose/debug modes
- Native Windows support
- Hook system implementation
- Homebrew formula creation (nice to have for v1.0 but not blocking)

## Risk Mitigation

**Linux Testing Risks**:
- Homebrew on Linux may have quirks ‚Üí Document workarounds
- Path setup differences ‚Üí Provide clear guidance
- Package availability ‚Üí Note any limitations

**Documentation Risks**:
- Outdated examples ‚Üí Review systematically
- Missing edge cases ‚Üí Add as discovered

## Post-Release

After v1.0:
1. Monitor issue reports
2. Plan v1.1 based on feedback
3. Consider package update command as first new feature
