# APT Implementation - Completion Summary

## Overview
APT package manager support has been successfully implemented for plonk, enabling Debian/Ubuntu users to manage system packages alongside other package managers.

## Completed Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Structure and Platform Detection ‚úÖ
- Created `internal/resources/packages/apt.go`
- Implemented platform detection (`platform.go`) to ensure APT only runs on Debian-based Linux
- Added APT to package manager registry
- Updated configuration validation to support APT
- Created comprehensive platform detection tests

### Phase 2: Read Operations ‚úÖ
- **IsAvailable**: Checks for Linux, Debian-based system, and required APT commands
- **IsInstalled**: Uses `dpkg-query` to check package installation status
- **InstalledVersion**: Retrieves version info for installed packages
- **Search**: Uses `apt-cache search --names-only` for package discovery
- **Info**: Uses `apt-cache show` to get detailed package information
- All operations tested with comprehensive unit tests

### Phase 3: Write Operations ‚úÖ
- **Install**: Uses `apt-get install --yes --no-install-recommends`
  - Clear permission error messages suggesting sudo usage
  - Handles already-installed packages gracefully
  - Network error detection and reporting
- **Uninstall**: Uses `apt-get remove --yes` (not purge)
  - Treats "not installed" as success (idempotent)
  - Dependency conflict detection
- Comprehensive error handling with helpful user messages

### Phase 4: Integration Testing ‚úÖ
- Created GitHub Actions-only integration tests to protect developer machines
- Test structure:
  - `test/integration/apt_test.go`: APT-specific operations
  - `test/integration/dotfiles_test.go`: Dotfile management tests
  - `test/integration/crossplatform_test.go`: Platform-specific behavior
- Added `test-integration` command to justfile with CI protection
- Updated CI workflow with dedicated integration test job

### Phase 5: Documentation üìù
- Created planning documents for each phase
- Updated CLAUDE.md with implementation progress
- This completion summary

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Platform Detection**: APT only available on Debian-based Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, etc.)
2. **Sudo Handling**: Fail with clear messages rather than prompt for passwords
3. **Package Operations**: Use `remove` not `purge` to preserve config files
4. **No Auto-Update**: Never run `apt-get update` automatically
5. **Minimal Installs**: Always use `--no-install-recommends`
6. **Integration Safety**: Tests only run in CI, never locally

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Platform detection logic
- Error handling scenarios
- Output parsing for search/info operations
- All tests pass on any platform

### Integration Tests
- Run only in GitHub Actions on Ubuntu
- Test real package installation/removal
- Verify lock file updates
- Test dotfile operations in isolation
- Clean up after each test

## Error Messages

Clear, actionable error messages for common scenarios:
- Permission denied ‚Üí "Try: sudo plonk install apt:package"
- Package not found ‚Üí "package 'name' not found"
- Network errors ‚Üí "network error: failed to download package information"
- Dependency conflicts ‚Üí Specific conflict information

## Platform Support

| Platform | APT Available | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| Ubuntu | ‚úÖ | Full support |
| Debian | ‚úÖ | Full support |
| macOS | ‚ùå | "not supported on this platform" |
| Other Linux | ‚ùå | Only Debian-based distributions |

## Future Enhancements

1. Support for other Linux package managers (yum/dnf, pacman, zypper)
2. Package name translation between managers
3. Virtual package handling
4. Architecture-specific packages (e.g., package:i386)
5. PPA support for Ubuntu
