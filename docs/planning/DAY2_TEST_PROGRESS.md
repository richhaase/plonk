# Day 2: Unit Test Progress Report

**Date**: 2025-07-31
**Task**: Add unit tests for pure business logic

## Summary

Added unit tests for critical business logic functions that had no coverage, focusing on pure functions that don't require external dependencies.

## Tests Added

### 1. Commands Package (`internal/commands`)

#### status_test.go
- `TestSortItems` - Tests case-insensitive sorting of resources
- `TestSortItemsByManager` - Tests manager grouping and sorting
- Coverage impact: 4.5% → 5.5%

#### apply_test.go
- `TestGetApplyScope` - Tests scope determination logic
- Coverage impact: Minimal but important logic covered

### 2. Diagnostics Package (`internal/diagnostics`)

#### health_test.go
- `TestGetHomebrewPath` - Tests platform-specific path detection
- `TestDetectShell` - Tests shell detection from path
- `TestGeneratePathExport` - Tests PATH export generation
- `TestGenerateShellCommands` - Tests shell-specific commands
- `TestCalculateOverallHealth` - Tests health status aggregation
- Coverage impact: 0% → 13.7%

## Key Functions Now Tested

| Function | Coverage | Importance |
|----------|----------|------------|
| `sortItems` | 100% | Ensures consistent UI display |
| `sortItemsByManager` | 100% | Groups packages logically |
| `getApplyScope` | 100% | Critical flag logic |
| `getHomebrewPath` | 50% | Platform detection |
| `detectShell` | 76.9% | Shell configuration |
| `generatePathExport` | 100% | PATH setup |
| `generateShellCommands` | 100% | Shell integration |
| `calculateOverallHealth` | 100% | Health aggregation |

## Coverage Improvements

### Before Day 2
- Commands: 4.5%
- Diagnostics: 0.0%
- Overall: ~30%

### After Day 2
- Commands: 5.5% (+1.0%)
- Diagnostics: 13.7% (+13.7%)
- Overall: Improved but still needs work

## Challenges Encountered

1. **Implementation Details**: Had to match exact strings and behavior from implementation
2. **Status Values**: Discovered "fail" vs "error", different messages than expected
3. **Shell Detection**: Found that "sh" defaults to "bash" behavior

## Test Quality

All tests added are:
- ✅ Pure unit tests (no external calls)
- ✅ Table-driven where appropriate
- ✅ Cover edge cases (empty, single item, special characters)
- ✅ Test business logic, not implementation details

## Next Steps for Day 3

1. **Add tests for remaining commands**:
   - info.go - package lookup logic
   - search.go - result aggregation
   - config_edit.go - validation logic

2. **Test reconciliation logic**:
   - More comprehensive reconcile tests
   - State transition tests

3. **Test error handling**:
   - Error message formatting
   - Command validation failures

4. **Test output formatting**:
   - Table builders
   - JSON/YAML serialization

## Recommendations

1. **Focus Areas**:
   - Commands package needs most attention (5.5% coverage)
   - Orchestrator logic (16.3% coverage)

2. **Quick Wins**:
   - Simple validation functions
   - Error message formatting
   - Path manipulation functions

3. **Defer Complex Tests**:
   - Functions requiring extensive mocking
   - Integration-like behaviors
   - External system interactions
