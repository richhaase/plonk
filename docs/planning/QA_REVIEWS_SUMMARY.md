# Quality Assurance Reviews Summary

This document summarizes the QA reviews completed on 2025-08-01 for v1.0 release readiness.

## Completed Reviews

### 1. Code Complexity Review
**File**: `code-complexity-review.md`
**Key Findings**:
- Analyzed 105 Go files, 19,337 lines, 3,860 total complexity
- Found 7 functions exceeding 100 lines (mostly in presentation layer)
- Identified duplicate patterns in validation, error handling, table building
- **Recommendation**: NO refactoring before v1.0 - code is stable and well-tested
- Estimated 20-30 hours of refactoring work for post-v1.0

### 2. Critical Documentation Review
**File**: `documentation-review.md`
**Key Findings**:
- Found outdated references to defunct `setup` and `init` commands
- Fixed references in README.md
- All command documentation accurate and comprehensive
- **Action Items**: Remove stability warning and update version for v1.0

### 3. Justfile and GitHub Actions Review
**File**: `justfile-github-actions-review.md`
**Key Findings**:
- Removed non-existent `generate-mocks` reference
- Removed unused manual release commands
- Updated security workflow to run on main branch
- Updated CI matrix to Go 1.23/1.24 (matching requirements)
- **Note**: Go 1.23 required due to tool dependencies

## Historical Documents

### Command Executor Interface Plan
**File**: `COMMAND_EXECUTOR_INTERFACE_PLAN.md`
**Purpose**: Documented the test architecture improvement that enabled unit testing without system modification
**Result**: Successfully implemented, achieved 61.7% test coverage

### v1.0 Readiness Checklist
**File**: `v1-readiness.md`
**Purpose**: Original requirements and tracking document for v1.0 features
**Status**: All critical features completed, serves as historical record

## Recommendations

1. **Keep for Reference**:
   - All QA review documents (completed 2025-08-01)
   - This summary document

2. **Archive/Remove**:
   - `README.md` - Outdated status information
   - `COMMAND_EXECUTOR_INTERFACE_PLAN.md` - Implementation complete
   - `v1-readiness.md` - All items complete, superseded by CLAUDE.md

The QA reviews provide valuable post-v1.0 roadmap information and should be retained for future reference.
