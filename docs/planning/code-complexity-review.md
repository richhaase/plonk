# Code Complexity Review Report

Date: 2025-08-01

## Overview

This report summarizes the code complexity analysis performed on the plonk codebase as part of the pre-v1.0 quality assurance phase.

### Metrics Summary
- **Total Go Files**: 105 files with 19,337 lines of code
- **Total Complexity**: 3,860 (average: 36.8 per file)
- **Test Coverage**: 61.7% for packages (achieved target of 60%+)

## High Complexity Areas

### 1. Functions Exceeding 100 Lines

The following functions were identified as having more than 100 lines:

| File | Function | Lines | Description |
|------|----------|-------|-------------|
| status.go | TableOutput() | 236 | Generates human-friendly table output for status command |
| install.go | runInstall() | 120 | Main logic for install command |
| info.go | getInfoWithPriorityLogic() | 114 | Handles package info retrieval with fallback logic |
| uninstall.go | runUninstall() | 112 | Main logic for uninstall command |
| apply.go | CombinedApplyOutput.TableOutput() | 110 | Table output for apply command results |
| search.go | searchAllManagersParallel() | 108 | Parallel search across all package managers |
| operations.go | installSinglePackage() | 103 | Core package installation logic |

### 2. Files with Highest Complexity

Using scc's complexity metric:

1. **dotfiles/manager.go** - Complexity: 192, Lines: 980
   - Manages dotfile operations, directory expansion, and state reconciliation
   - Contains multiple responsibilities that could be split

2. **packages/homebrew.go** - Complexity: 120, Lines: 406
   - Complex parsing of Homebrew's JSON output
   - Error handling for various edge cases

3. **packages/pip.go** - Complexity: 108, Lines: 392
   - Python package management with virtual environment considerations
   - Complex version parsing logic

4. **commands/status.go** - Complexity: 103, Lines: 524
   - Multiple display modes and filtering options
   - Complex table building logic

5. **packages/npm.go** - Complexity: 103, Lines: 406
   - NPM global package management
   - JSON parsing and error handling

### 3. Duplicate Code Patterns Identified

#### Pattern 1: Package Specification Parsing
Found in: install.go, uninstall.go, info.go, search.go
```go
manager, packageName := ParsePackageSpec(packageSpec)
// Followed by similar validation logic in each file
```

#### Pattern 2: Error Result Formatting
Found 15+ instances in operations.go:
```go
result.Status = "failed"
result.Error = fmt.Errorf("install %s: ...", packageName, ...)
```

#### Pattern 3: Table Building
Similar patterns in status.go and info.go:
```go
builder := NewStandardTableBuilder("")
builder.SetHeaders(...)
// Loop with builder.AddRow(...)
```

#### Pattern 4: Context Timeout Management
Found in 15+ locations:
```go
ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(parentCtx, timeout)
defer cancel()
```

## Refactoring Opportunities

### High Priority (Quick Wins)

1. **Extract Package Validation Function**
   - Create a shared function for validating package specifications
   - Would reduce duplication in 4+ command files
   - Estimated effort: 1-2 hours

2. **Standardize Error Result Creation**
   - Create helper functions for common error patterns in operations.go
   - Would reduce ~15 similar error formatting blocks
   - Estimated effort: 1-2 hours

3. **Extract Common Table Rendering Logic**
   - Consolidate table building patterns from status.go and info.go
   - Would reduce code duplication and standardize output
   - Estimated effort: 2-3 hours

### Medium Priority

1. **Break Down Long Functions**
   - Split functions >100 lines into logical sub-functions
   - Focus on TableOutput() and command run functions
   - Estimated effort: 4-6 hours

2. **Create Context Helper**
   - Standardize timeout context creation with configurable defaults
   - Would simplify 15+ timeout management locations
   - Estimated effort: 2-3 hours

3. **Consolidate Manager Availability Checks**
   - Extract repeated manager availability validation
   - Found in install, uninstall, info, search operations
   - Estimated effort: 2-3 hours

### Low Priority (Post-v1.0)

1. **Reduce Test File Complexity**
   - Some test files exceed 100 complexity score
   - Could be addressed during future test improvements
   - Estimated effort: 3-4 hours

2. **Standardize Config Loading**
   - Create helper for repeated config.LoadWithDefaults() pattern
   - Minor improvement for consistency
   - Estimated effort: 1-2 hours

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Areas
- Most complexity is in the presentation layer (status output, table formatting)
- These areas are well-tested through integration tests
- Refactoring would primarily improve readability

### Medium Risk Areas
- Package operation error handling has complex branching logic
- Changes here could affect core functionality
- Mitigation: Good test coverage (61.7%) reduces risk

### Areas to Avoid Before v1.0
- Core reconciliation logic in dotfiles/manager.go works correctly
- Package manager implementations are battle-tested
- Major architectural changes should wait for post-v1.0

## Recommendations

### For v1.0 Release
1. **Do NOT refactor** - The code works correctly and has good test coverage
2. **Document the findings** - This report serves as input for post-v1.0 improvements
3. **Focus on stability** - Current complexity doesn't impact functionality

### Post-v1.0 Refactoring Plan
1. Start with high-priority quick wins (validation, error helpers)
2. These extractions will naturally reduce function lengths
3. Tackle long functions after common patterns are extracted
4. Consider splitting dotfiles/manager.go into focused modules

## Conclusion

The codebase shows typical complexity patterns for a CLI tool of this size. While there are opportunities for improvement, the current state is acceptable for v1.0 release. The identified patterns provide a clear roadmap for post-v1.0 refactoring that will improve maintainability without risking stability.

Total estimated effort for all improvements: 20-30 hours (best done incrementally post-v1.0)
