# Plonk Development Progress

## âœ… Completed Work Summary

### Phase 1: Foundation (100% Complete)
1. **Dotfiles Package** - Extracted file operations with 100% test coverage
2. **Error System** - Structured errors with user-friendly messages  
3. **Context Support** - Cancellable operations with configurable timeouts
4. **Test Isolation** - All tests verified safe from system interference

### Early Phase 2 (Completed Ahead of Schedule)  
5. **Configuration Interfaces** - Clean abstraction with adapters, removed tight coupling
6. **Documentation Updates** - Updated ARCHITECTURE.md to reflect new configuration architecture
7. **Context Cancellation Tests** - Comprehensive tests for context cancellation during long operations

**Architecture**: Clean separation into Configuration, Package Management, Dotfiles, State, and Commands.

## ðŸš§ Current Work

### In Progress
- None

## ðŸŽ¯ Remaining Work (Priority Order)

### Phase 2: Quality Improvements
1. **Package Manager Error Handling** (Low effort, Medium impact)
   - Change `IsInstalled() bool` to `IsInstalled() (bool, error)`
   - Preserve error context for better debugging

2. **File Operations Enhancement** (Medium effort, Medium impact)
   - Atomic operations (temp file + rename)
   - Progress reporting for large transfers
   - Better permission handling

3. **Extract Provider Logic with Generics** (High effort, Medium impact)
   - Create `BaseProvider[T, U]` to reduce duplication
   - Share common reconciliation logic

### Phase 3: Nice-to-Have
- Comprehensive logging
- Metrics collection  
- Functional options pattern
- Concurrent provider reconciliation
- Code organization improvements
