### Phase 3: Isolated Integration Testing (100% Complete)
10. **Docker-Based Testing Infrastructure** - Ubuntu 22.04 + Homebrew + NPM + Go containerized environment
11. **Comprehensive Integration Test Suite** - 12 test files covering all major scenarios
12. **Developer-Friendly Workflow** - Just commands for easy test execution and debugging
13. **Performance and Security Validation** - Benchmarks and vulnerability testing
14. **Idiomatic Go Test Structure** - Proper test organization following Go best practices

**Architecture**: Clean separation into Configuration, Package Management, Dotfiles, State, and Commands with world-class testing infrastructure.

## ðŸŽ¯ All Development Phases Complete

### Development Status: âœ… **COMPLETE**

## ðŸ§ª Comprehensive Integration Testing Details

### Test Infrastructure
**Platform**: Ubuntu 22.04 containerized environment with:
- **Homebrew** (Linux) + **NPM** + **APT** package managers
- **Go 1.21.6** for building plonk binary
- **Fresh containers** for each test run (perfect isolation)
- **Real package managers** (no mocking) for authentic testing

### Test Categories

#### **Core Functionality** (4 test files)
- **Binary Tests**: Help, version, basic commands
- **Configuration Tests**: Show, validation, JSON/YAML output
- **Dotfile Tests**: Add, deploy, backup, status operations
- **Package Tests**: Homebrew, NPM, APT operations

#### **Advanced Scenarios** (6 test files)
- **Workflow Tests**: Complete user journeys (new user, migration, development)
- **State Tests**: Configuration persistence, synchronization, atomic operations
- **Cross-Manager Tests**: Mixed Homebrew/NPM, manager switching, conflicts
- **Error Recovery Tests**: Corruption, permissions, network failures
- **Performance Tests**: Large configs, concurrent operations, benchmarks
- **Security Tests**: Input validation, privilege escalation, path traversal

### Developer Commands
```bash
just test-integration              # Full integration tests (~10 min)
just test-integration-fast         # Fast tests with -short flag (~5 min)
just test-integration-setup        # Build Docker image only
just test-all                      # Unit + integration tests
just clean-docker                  # Clean Docker artifacts
