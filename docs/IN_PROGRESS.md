# Plonk Development Progress

## ✅ Completed Work Summary

### Phase 1: Foundation (100% Complete)
1. **Dotfiles Package** - Extracted file operations with 100% test coverage
2. **Error System** - Structured errors with user-friendly messages  
3. **Context Support** - Cancellable operations with configurable timeouts
4. **Test Isolation** - All tests verified safe from system interference

### Early Phase 2 (Completed Ahead of Schedule)  
5. **Configuration Interfaces** - Clean abstraction with adapters, removed tight coupling
6. **Documentation Updates** - Updated ARCHITECTURE.md to reflect new configuration architecture
7. **Context Cancellation Tests** - Comprehensive tests for context cancellation during long operations

**Architecture**: Clean separation into Configuration, Package Management, Dotfiles, State, and Commands.

## 🚧 Current Work

### In Progress
- None

## 🎯 Remaining Work (Priority Order)

### Phase 2: Quality Improvements (Revised)
1. **Package Manager Error Handling** (Low effort, Medium value) - ✅ **Approved**
   - Change `IsInstalled() bool` to `IsInstalled() (bool, error)`
   - Preserve error context for better debugging
   - Aligns with Go best practices, improves troubleshooting

2. **Atomic File Operations** (Low effort, Medium value) - ✅ **Approved**
   - Implement temp file + rename pattern for atomic writes
   - Prevents partial writes during failures
   - Solid reliability improvement for dotfile operations

### Phase 3: Deferred/Rejected Items
- **File Progress Reporting** - ❌ **Rejected** (Low value for typical dotfile operations)
- **Enhanced Permission Handling** - ❌ **Rejected** (Current implementation adequate)
- **Provider Logic Generics** - ❌ **Rejected** (High complexity, minimal benefit)
- **Comprehensive logging** - 🔄 **Deferred**
- **Metrics collection** - 🔄 **Deferred**
- **Functional options pattern** - 🔄 **Deferred**
- **Concurrent provider reconciliation** - 🔄 **Deferred**
- **Code organization improvements** - 🔄 **Deferred**

## 📊 Quick Reference

| Phase 2 Items | Value | Effort | Status |
|---------------|-------|--------|--------|
| Package manager error handling | Medium | Low | ✅ Approved |
| Atomic file operations | Medium | Low | ✅ Approved |
| ~~File progress reporting~~ | Low | Medium | ❌ Rejected |
| ~~Provider generics~~ | Low | High | ❌ Rejected |
| ~~Enhanced permissions~~ | Low | Low | ❌ Rejected |

**Phase 2 Scope:** 2 focused improvements for maximum value with minimal complexity

## 🔍 Phase 2 Decision Analysis

**Approved Items:**
- **Package Manager Error Handling**: Clear value for debugging, aligns with Go best practices, minimal effort
- **Atomic File Operations**: Solid reliability improvement, prevents partial writes, low implementation risk

**Rejected Items:**
- **File Progress Reporting**: Low value (dotfile operations are typically small/fast), medium complexity
- **Provider Generics**: High complexity with minimal benefit, current interface-based approach is idiomatic Go
- **Enhanced Permissions**: Current implementation already preserves permissions correctly

**Key Principles Applied:**
- Maximize value-to-effort ratio
- Maintain code simplicity and readability
- Follow Go idioms and best practices
- Avoid premature optimization

**Status**: 49/49 tasks complete (100%) • Phase 1 COMPLETE • Phase 2 revised and scoped • Ready for implementation
