# Plonk Development Progress

## âœ… Completed Work Summary

### Phase 1: Foundation (100% Complete)
1. **Dotfiles Package** - Extracted file operations with 100% test coverage
2. **Error System** - Structured errors with user-friendly messages  
3. **Context Support** - Cancellable operations with configurable timeouts
4. **Test Isolation** - All tests verified safe from system interference

### Early Phase 2 (Completed Ahead of Schedule)  
5. **Configuration Interfaces** - Clean abstraction with adapters, removed tight coupling
6. **Documentation Updates** - Updated ARCHITECTURE.md to reflect new configuration architecture
7. **Context Cancellation Tests** - Comprehensive tests for context cancellation during long operations
8. **Package Manager Error Handling** - Enhanced all PackageManager methods with comprehensive error handling
9. **Atomic File Operations** - Implemented atomic file writes with temp file + rename pattern

**Architecture**: Clean separation into Configuration, Package Management, Dotfiles, State, and Commands.

## ðŸš§ Current Work

### In Progress
- **Phase 3: Isolated Integration Testing** - Designing containerized testing approach with real package managers

## ðŸŽ¯ Remaining Work (Priority Order)

### Phase 2: Quality Improvements (Revised)
1. **Package Manager Error Handling** (Low effort, Medium value) - âœ… **COMPLETED**
   - Enhanced all PackageManager methods with comprehensive error handling
   - Smart detection of expected conditions vs real errors
   - Context-aware error messages with actionable suggestions
   - Consistent patterns across Homebrew and NPM managers

2. **Atomic File Operations** (Low effort, Medium value) - âœ… **COMPLETED**
   - Implemented atomic file writes with temp file + rename pattern
   - All dotfile operations now atomic (copy, backup, directory operations)
   - All configuration saves now atomic (prevents config corruption)
   - Comprehensive error handling with proper cleanup on failures
   - Context cancellation support preserved throughout

### Phase 3: Isolated Integration Testing (High value, Medium effort)
**Approach**: Containerized integration testing with Linux containers + real package managers

#### Core Testing Requirements
- **Package Manager Integration**: Install/uninstall real packages (Homebrew, NPM, APT)
- **Dotfile Operations**: Copy, backup, symlink with edge cases and error scenarios
- **Configuration Management**: YAML manipulation, atomic operations, state transitions
- **Error Handling**: Network failures, permission issues, corrupted states, real package manager failures

```

#### Container Environment
- **Base**: Ubuntu/Debian with Homebrew installed
- **Fresh filesystem** for each test run (perfect isolation)
- **Real package managers** (Homebrew, npm, apt) for authentic testing
- **Isolated home directory** with controlled test dotfiles
- **Network access** for real package downloads and dependency resolution

#### Developer Workflow
```bash
make test-integration          # Run all integration tests (~5-10 min)
make test-integration-fast     # Core scenarios only (~2-3 min)
make test-integration-debug    # Interactive container for debugging
```

#### Test Strategy
- **Thoroughness over speed**: Comprehensive scenarios with real external dependencies
- **Fresh container per test**: No state pollution between tests
- **Cross-platform validation**: Linux containers + macOS CI runners
- **Error scenario focus**: Real package manager failures, network issues, permission problems
