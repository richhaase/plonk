# Plonk Development Progress

## âœ… Completed Work Summary

### Phase 1: Foundation (100% Complete)
1. **Dotfiles Package** - Extracted file operations with 100% test coverage
2. **Error System** - Structured errors with user-friendly messages  
3. **Context Support** - Cancellable operations with configurable timeouts
4. **Test Isolation** - All tests verified safe from system interference

### Early Phase 2 (Completed Ahead of Schedule)  
5. **Configuration Interfaces** - Clean abstraction with adapters, removed tight coupling
6. **Documentation Updates** - Updated ARCHITECTURE.md to reflect new configuration architecture
7. **Context Cancellation Tests** - Comprehensive tests for context cancellation during long operations
8. **Package Manager Error Handling** - Enhanced all PackageManager methods with comprehensive error handling
9. **Atomic File Operations** - Implemented atomic file writes with temp file + rename pattern

**Architecture**: Clean separation into Configuration, Package Management, Dotfiles, State, and Commands.

## ðŸš§ Current Work

### In Progress
- None

## ðŸŽ¯ Remaining Work (Priority Order)

### Phase 2: Quality Improvements (Revised)
1. **Package Manager Error Handling** (Low effort, Medium value) - âœ… **COMPLETED**
   - Enhanced all PackageManager methods with comprehensive error handling
   - Smart detection of expected conditions vs real errors
   - Context-aware error messages with actionable suggestions
   - Consistent patterns across Homebrew and NPM managers

2. **Atomic File Operations** (Low effort, Medium value) - âœ… **COMPLETED**
   - Implemented atomic file writes with temp file + rename pattern
   - All dotfile operations now atomic (copy, backup, directory operations)
   - All configuration saves now atomic (prevents config corruption)
   - Comprehensive error handling with proper cleanup on failures
   - Context cancellation support preserved throughout

### Phase 3: Research integration testing solution
- **Requirement**: Test isolation from develop environment
