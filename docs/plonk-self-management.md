# Plonk Self-Management

**Status**: ðŸš§ **IN DEVELOPMENT** - Implementation planned
**Priority**: High
**Target Release**: v1.2.0

## Overview

Plonk self-management provides a streamlined bootstrap and maintenance experience for seasoned users. Instead of the traditional "install package manager â†’ install plonk â†’ use plonk" flow, self-management enables a direct "install plonk â†’ use plonk" experience.

This feature maintains plonk's core philosophy as a "package manager manager" - it's about bootstrapping, not replacing the underlying package managers.

## Motivation

For experienced plonk users setting up new development environments, the fastest possible path is:

```bash
# Traditional flow
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew install richhaase/tap/plonk
plonk clone username/dotfiles

# Self-managed flow
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richhaase/plonk/main/install.sh | bash
plonk clone username/dotfiles
```

While the difference is minor, eliminating the intermediate Homebrew step provides value for rapid environment setup, especially in automated scenarios, containers, or when setting up multiple machines.

## Core Principles

### 1. Bootstrap Only
Self-management is about getting plonk onto a system quickly. It does not:
- Install other package managers
- Replace plonk's delegation to existing package managers
- Change plonk's architectural role as a coordinator

### 2. Maintain Package Manager Integration
Plonk continues to delegate all package operations to appropriate package managers (brew, npm, cargo, etc.). Self-management only affects how plonk itself is installed and updated.

### 3. Coexist with Traditional Installation
Users can freely switch between installation methods:
- Install via script, update via Homebrew
- Install via Homebrew, update via self-update
- Mix and match as needed

## Features

### Installation Script

**Command**: `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richhaase/plonk/main/install.sh | bash`

**Functionality**:
- Detects platform (macOS/Linux, Intel/ARM)
- Downloads latest plonk binary from GitHub releases
- Installs to `/usr/local/bin/plonk`
- Verifies installation with version check
- **Scope**: Only installs plonk binary - no package managers, no automatic clone

**Platform Support**:
- macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon)
- Linux (x86_64 and ARM64)
- Windows support via WSL2

### Self-Update Command

**Command**: `plonk self-update`

**Functionality**:
- Queries GitHub releases API for latest version
- Compares against currently installed version
- Downloads and verifies new binary if update available
- Replaces current installation atomically
- Provides `--dry-run` option to preview updates

**Update Process**:
1. Check GitHub API for latest release
2. Compare versions (semantic version comparison)
3. Download binary and checksums.txt
4. Verify SHA256 checksum for integrity
5. Replace current binary
6. Verify new installation

**Safety Features**:
- SHA256 checksum verification against official checksums.txt
- Fail-fast on download errors
- Version verification after update
- Clear error messages for troubleshooting

### Self-Uninstall Command

**Command**: `plonk self-uninstall`

**Functionality**:
- Removes plonk binary from system
- Removes `~/.config/plonk/` directory completely
- Complete cleanup approach

**What Gets Removed**:
- Plonk executable binary
- Configuration directory (`~/.config/plonk/`)
- Lock file (`plonk.lock`)
- Stored dotfile copies

**What Gets Preserved**:
- **User's actual dotfiles** - These are copied to `$HOME`, not symlinked
- **Installed packages** - Package managers retain all installed software
- **Package managers themselves** - Homebrew, npm, etc. remain installed

**Data Recovery**:
- Dotfiles remain in their deployed locations (`~/.zshrc`, `~/.vimrc`, etc.)
- Packages remain installed and functional
- Lock file can be recreated with `plonk status` after reinstallation

## Security Considerations

### Checksum Verification
All downloads are verified using SHA256 checksums:
- Each GitHub release includes `checksums.txt` with SHA256 hashes
- Installation script and self-update verify binary integrity
- Protection against corrupted downloads and basic tampering

### Code Signing
macOS binaries are code-signed and notarized:
- Eliminates security warnings on macOS
- Provides cryptographic verification of binary authenticity
- Automated via GoReleaser configuration

### Future: GPG Signing
If user demand justifies the additional complexity:
- GPG signatures for releases
- Enhanced cryptographic verification
- Protection against sophisticated attacks

## Use Cases

### 1. Rapid Environment Setup
**Scenario**: Setting up a new development machine or VM
```bash
# Single-command bootstrap
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richhaase/plonk/main/install.sh | bash
plonk clone myusername/dotfiles
# Fully configured development environment
```

### 2. Container Environments
**Scenario**: Building development containers or CI environments
```dockerfile
# Dockerfile
RUN curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richhaase/plonk/main/install.sh | bash
RUN plonk clone organization/standard-config
```

### 3. Automated Provisioning
**Scenario**: Infrastructure-as-code or automated machine setup
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Bootstrap script for new team members
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richhaase/plonk/main/install.sh | bash
plonk clone company/developer-setup
```

### 4. Maintenance Operations
**Scenario**: Keeping plonk updated without package manager dependency
```bash
plonk self-update  # Update plonk itself
# Continue using plonk for package management
```
