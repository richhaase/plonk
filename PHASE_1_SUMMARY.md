# Phase 1 Summary - Interface Reduction

## Completed Actions

### 1. Removed Unused Config Interfaces from `internal/interfaces/config.go`
- **Deleted interfaces with zero implementations:**
  - `Config` (empty interface)
  - `ConfigReader`
  - `ConfigWriter`
  - `ConfigValidator`
  - `DomainConfigLoader`
  - `ConfigService`
- **Preserved:** `DotfileConfigLoader` (actively used by state package)
- **Also removed:** `internal/mocks/config_mocks.go` (mocks for deleted interfaces)

### 2. Removed BatchProcessor from `internal/operations/types.go`
- Deleted the `BatchProcessor` interface (made obsolete by Command Pipeline Dismantling)
- Removed unused `context` import

### 3. Removed Unused Operations Interfaces
- **Deleted entire `internal/interfaces/operations.go` file containing:**
  - `BatchProcessor` interface (duplicate of the one in operations/types.go)
  - `ProgressReporter` interface (duplicate with actual implementation in operations package)
  - `OutputRenderer` interface (no implementations found)
  - `OperationResult` struct (duplicate of operations package)
  - `BatchOperationResult` struct (only used by deleted interfaces)
- **Also removed:** `internal/mocks/operations_mocks.go`

## Impact Summary

### Files Deleted:
- `internal/interfaces/operations.go`
- `internal/mocks/config_mocks.go`
- `internal/mocks/operations_mocks.go`

### Interfaces Removed: 10
- 6 config interfaces (Config, ConfigReader, ConfigWriter, ConfigValidator, DomainConfigLoader, ConfigService)
- 1 operations interface from types.go (BatchProcessor)
- 3 operations interfaces from interfaces package (BatchProcessor, ProgressReporter, OutputRenderer)

### Lines of Code Removed: ~400+
- Eliminated speculative architecture that was never implemented
- Removed duplicate interface definitions
- Cleaned up unused mock files

### Interfaces Retained:
- `DotfileConfigLoader` - actively used for dotfile configuration
- `Provider` - polymorphic state provider interface
- `PackageManager` - polymorphic package manager interface
- `CommandExecutor` - used for command execution abstraction
- `PackageConfigLoader` - used for package configuration
- And others that provide genuine value through polymorphism

## Next Steps

**Phase 2** (Medium Risk): Address adapter interfaces
- Evaluate `ConfigInterface` adapter in state/adapters.go

**Phase 3** (Low Risk): Review single-implementation interfaces
- Consider inlining `LockReader`, `LockWriter`, `LockService`
- Consider inlining `ProgressReporter` in operations/types.go

All tests pass after Phase 1 changes.
