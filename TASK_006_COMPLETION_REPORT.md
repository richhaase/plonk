# Task 006 Completion Report: Delete Operations Package

## Overview
Successfully deleted the `operations` package by distributing its functionality to more appropriate domain packages. This completes the systematic package reduction effort, moving from 16 to 15 packages.

## What Was Moved

### 1. Core Types → `state/operations.go`
- **OperationResult struct**: Central type for representing operation results
- **ResultSummary struct**: Aggregate statistics for batch operations
- **CalculateSummary() function**: Generates summaries from operation arrays
- **CountByStatus() function**: Counts results with specific status

**Rationale**: These types represent operation state and fit naturally with other state types in the state package.

### 2. Progress Reporting → `ui/progress.go`
- **DefaultProgressReporter struct**: Standard progress reporting implementation
- **NewProgressReporter() function**: Factory for basic progress reporters
- **NewProgressReporterForOperation() function**: Factory for operation-specific reporters
- **ShowItemProgress() method**: Displays individual item progress
- **ShowBatchSummary() method**: Shows aggregate operation summaries
- **FormatErrorWithSuggestion() function**: Formats errors with helpful suggestions

**Rationale**: This is UI logic that belongs in the ui package for better separation of concerns.

### 3. Context Utilities → `commands/helpers.go`
- **CreateOperationContext() function**: Creates contexts with timeouts
- **CheckCancellation() function**: Checks for context cancellation
- **DetermineExitCode() function**: Determines exit codes from results
- **getErrorCodeForDomain() function**: Maps domains to error codes

**Rationale**: These are simple utilities used primarily by commands, so they fit better in the commands package.

## Import Updates

Updated imports in **6 consuming files**:
- `internal/commands/add.go`
- `internal/commands/install.go`
- `internal/commands/rm.go`
- `internal/commands/uninstall.go`
- `internal/core/dotfiles.go`
- `internal/ui/formatters.go`

All imports changed from `"github.com/richhaase/plonk/internal/operations"` to:
- `"github.com/richhaase/plonk/internal/state"` (for core types)
- `"github.com/richhaase/plonk/internal/ui"` (for progress reporting)

## Simplifications Made

1. **Consolidated related functionality**: Progress reporting is now co-located with other UI components
2. **Eliminated unnecessary abstraction**: Context utilities are now simple helper functions where they're used
3. **Improved package cohesion**: Each piece of functionality is now in its most appropriate domain

## Test Results
✅ All tests pass after the refactoring:
- `internal/commands`: ✅ 0.205s
- `internal/state`: ✅ 0.195s
- All other packages: ✅ (cached from previous runs)

No test failures or broken functionality detected.

## Package Architecture Impact

**Before**: 16 packages total
**After**: 15 packages total (-1)

### Removed:
- `internal/operations/` (eliminated completely)

### Enhanced:
- `internal/state/` (now contains operation result types)
- `internal/ui/` (now contains progress reporting)
- `internal/commands/helpers.go` (now contains context utilities)

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Reduced complexity**: Eliminated an intermediate abstraction layer
2. **Better organization**: Each component is now in its most logical domain
3. **Cleaner dependencies**: Removed the operations package from the import graph
4. **Maintained functionality**: All existing features work exactly as before

## Success Criteria ✅

- ✅ No remaining operations package
- ✅ All functionality preserved in new locations
- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ Cleaner package organization
- ✅ Package count reduced from 16 to 15

## File Changes Summary

**Created:**
- `internal/state/operations.go` (core types)
- `internal/ui/progress.go` (progress reporting)

**Modified:**
- `internal/commands/helpers.go` (added context utilities)
- `internal/commands/add.go` (updated imports)
- `internal/commands/install.go` (updated imports)
- `internal/commands/rm.go` (updated imports)
- `internal/commands/uninstall.go` (updated imports)
- `internal/core/dotfiles.go` (updated imports)
- `internal/ui/formatters.go` (updated imports)

**Deleted:**
- `internal/operations/` (entire directory)
  - `types.go`
  - `progress.go`
  - `context.go`
  - `types_test.go`

The operations package deletion is complete and successful. The codebase is now more organized with better separation of concerns while maintaining all existing functionality.
