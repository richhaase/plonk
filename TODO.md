### Last Session Summary (July 6, 2025)
**Comprehensive CLI validation and build process improvements completed:**
- Fixed build artifacts location (now uses `build/` directory instead of repo root)
- Removed incomplete verbose/quiet flags implementation  
- Completed full manual validation of all CLI functionality (22/22 tests passed)
- Updated CONTRIBUTING.md with source installation instructions
- All core plonk functionality validated and working correctly

**Current state:** Plonk CLI is fully functional and ready for production use. All major workflows validated: status, import, install, apply, package management, and repository operations.
