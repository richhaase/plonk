### Current Session Summary (July 7, 2025)
**Successfully migrated from Just to Mage build tool:**
- **Go-native tooling**: Replaced shell-based Just with Go-native Mage
- **Performance improvement**: 33% faster build times (0.348s vs 0.520s)
- **Simplified toolchain**: One fewer external dependency to manage
- **Better cross-platform support**: Especially improved Windows compatibility
- **Type safety**: Build logic now validated at compile time
- **Feature parity**: All essential development tasks preserved

**Current state:** Plonk now uses Go-native Mage for all development tasks. Migration complete with full validation and documentation updates. Ready for production use with improved build tooling.
