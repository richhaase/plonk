## Current Session Focus

**Primary Goal:** Phase 2 - Package Management UI Redesign
**Session Date:** July 7, 2025
**Estimated Time:** 2 hours

## Active Work Items

### Completed This Session
- [x] Phase 1: Removed existing interface code/tests (8400+ lines) âœ…
- [x] Created new focused CLI structure (`plonk pkg`) âœ…
- [x] Migrated from dev.go to justfile for development workflow âœ…
- [x] Separated dotfiles from package managers into pkg/dotfiles âœ…
- [x] Drastically simplified package managers (2,224 â†’ ~150 lines) âœ…
- [x] Removed all abstraction layers (CommandExecutor, CommandRunner, PackageInfo) âœ…
- [x] Basic `plonk pkg list` working and fast âœ…

### Phase 2 Tasks (Next Up)

#### Immediate Next Steps
- [ ] **Restructure to idiomatic Go layout** - Move pkg/* to internal/*
- [ ] **Fix broken tests and imports** - Update after simplification
- [ ] **Implement state-aware filters** - managed/untracked/missing at higher level
- [ ] **Create pkg status command** - using simplified managers
- [ ] **Design dotfiles UI** - plonk dot commands
- [ ] **Design config UI** - plonk config commands

#### Future Phases
- [ ] **Phase 3: Refactor and review interfaces**
- [ ] **Phase 4: Add workflow-focused tests**
- [ ] **Phase 5: Resume dogfooding with new UI**

## UI Redesign Phase Overview

**Phase 1:** Remove existing interface âœ… **COMPLETED**
**Phase 2:** Create UI one concept at a time ðŸ”„ **IN PROGRESS**
**Phase 3:** Refactor and review interfaces ðŸ“‹ **PLANNED**

## Current Blockers

- **Security Findings** - 34 gosec issues need resolution before public release  
- **Missing Integration Tests** - Need to create based on dogfooding scenarios

## Temporary Changes

- **Pre-commit Hooks Disabled** - Temporarily disabled to allow smooth dogfooding without security check failures

## Context for Next Session

- **Ready for Stage 1** - Dogfooding plan established, documentation clean
- **Key Decision** - Real-world validation before GitHub launch
- **Security Note** - Dogfooding can proceed while security fixes are planned

## Session Notes

**Current Session Progress:**
1. **Major UI/UX Improvement**: Fixed import command path issue (import_cmd.go:109) - now saves to `.config/plonk/plonk.yaml` instead of `.config/plonk/repo/plonk.yaml`
2. **Architecture Enhancement**: Created comprehensive DotfilesManager interface with rich DotfileInfo objects and state-aware methods (managed/untracked/missing/modified)
3. **Status Command Enhancement**: Added full dotfiles status display to `plonk status` - now shows managed, untracked, missing, and modified dotfiles
4. **Interface Standardization**: Enhanced PackageManager interface with PackageInfo objects and state-aware methods (ListManagedPackages, ListUntrackedPackages, ListMissingPackages) to match DotfilesManager patterns

**Working Patterns for This Session:**
1. **Focus Area**: Dogfooding Plonk with real environment to identify and fix UI/UX issues
2. **Documentation Updates**: Update *.md docs as we go to ensure accuracy (design decisions â†’ ARCHITECTURE.md)
3. **Code Changes**: Use TDD redâ†’greenâ†’refactor cycles, small changes, frequent commits
4. **Interface Consistency**: Making DotfilesManager and PackageManager use similar patterns for state-aware functionality

**Technical Progress:**
- **DotfilesManager**: Complete implementation with ignore patterns, file size limits, status detection
- **PackageManager Enhancement**: Added PackageInfo struct, state-aware methods, config integration
- **Status Command**: Now displays both package and dotfiles management status with detailed information
- **Testing**: All tests pass with comprehensive coverage for new state-aware methods
- **Cleanup**: Removed ZSH plugin management functionality

**Next Steps:**
1. Update status command to use enhanced PackageManager methods  
2. Review interface consistency between DotfilesManager and PackageManager
3. Continue dogfooding workflow
4. Import existing setup into Plonk format
