## Notes

### Current Session Summary (July 7, 2025)
**Major GitHub launch preparation achievements:**

**🎯 Professional Versioning System:**
- Comprehensive versioning with Masterminds/semver library
- Automated changelog management following Keep a Changelog format
- Git tagging workflow with release management commands
- Successfully dogfooded with v0.2.0 release

**⚖️ Legal Foundation:**
- MIT License for maximum compatibility and adoption
- Professional license headers across 71 Go files with Rich Haase copyright
- Clear IP ownership for business flexibility and legal clarity
- Automated license header management tooling

**🔧 Pure Go Development Workflow:**
- Unified tooling via go.mod for consistent versions across environments
- Single quality gate: `go run dev.go precommit`
- Pure Go task runner (dev.go + internal/tasks/) with zero external dependencies
- Simplified git hooks calling dev.go for development/CI consistency
- Cross-platform Go-native development experience
- Eliminated tool fragmentation (ASDF only needed for Go runtime)
- Added comprehensive security scanning (gosec, govulncheck)

**🏗️ Development Infrastructure:**
- Migrated from Just to Mage for Go-native task running (33% performance improvement)
- Enhanced cross-platform support and type-safe build logic
- Comprehensive documentation updates across all project files

**Current state:** Plonk has professional-grade versioning, legal compliance, all-Go development workflow, and modern build tooling. Ready for GitHub launch with enterprise-level project standards. Next: Address security findings and setup CI/CD.
