# Phase 5 Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented lock file v2 format and hook system for plonk, preparing the foundation for AI Lab features while maintaining full backward compatibility.

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ Task 5.1: Define Lock v2 Schema (1 hour)
- **File Created**: `internal/lock/schema_v2.go`
- **Key Features**:
  - LockV2 struct with version 2 support
  - Generic ResourceEntry structure for extensible resource types
  - Backward compatible Package struct
  - LockData internal representation

### ✅ Task 5.2: Implement Lock File Migration (2 hours)
- **Files Modified**: `internal/lock/yaml_lock.go`, `internal/lock/interfaces.go`
- **Key Features**:
  - Version detection for v1/v2 lock files
  - Automatic migration from v1 to v2 on write
  - Comprehensive test coverage with migration scenarios
  - Zero data loss during migration
  - Migration logging with user feedback

### ✅ Task 5.3: Update Resource Integration (1.5 hours)
- **File Created**: `internal/orchestrator/orchestrator.go`
- **Key Features**:
  - Orchestrator manages all resources through unified interface
  - Resources written to lock file v2 format
  - Backward compatibility maintained in packages section
  - Resource-specific metadata handling

### ✅ Task 5.4: Implement Hook System (2.5 hours)
- **Files Created**: `internal/orchestrator/hooks.go`
- **Files Modified**: `internal/config/config.go`, `internal/orchestrator/orchestrator.go`
- **Key Features**:
  - HookRunner with configurable timeouts
  - Pre-sync and post-sync hook execution
  - Timeout support with default 10-minute limit
  - Continue-on-error functionality
  - Hook integration into orchestrator sync flow

### ✅ Task 5.5: Add Hook Tests and Documentation (1 hour)
- **Files Created**:
  - `internal/orchestrator/hooks_test.go`
  - `internal/orchestrator/orchestrator_test.go`
  - `example-hooks.yaml`
- **Key Features**:
  - Comprehensive unit tests for business logic
  - No command execution in unit tests (integration test only)
  - Example configuration with common hook patterns
  - Hook configuration validation tests

### ✅ Task 5.6: Final Validation (1 hour)
- **Testing Results**:
  - All unit tests pass: `go test ./...` ✅
  - V1→V2 migration verified with test script ✅
  - Lock file migration logged correctly ✅
  - Resource tracking working in v2 format ✅

## Migration Test Results

```
=== Testing v1 to v2 Migration ===
Original version: 1
Packages found: 2 managers
  homebrew: 2 packages
  npm: 1 packages

=== Performing Migration ===
✅ Migration successful: File migrated to v2
Migrated version: 2
Resources found: 3
Backward compatible packages: 2 managers
```

**Key Migration Features Validated**:
- Automatic detection of v1 lock files
- Seamless migration to v2 format on write
- Package data preserved in both sections for compatibility
- Resource entries created with proper metadata
- Migration logging: "Migrated lock file from v1 to v2"

## Technical Achievements

### Lock File Format Evolution
- **V1 Format**: Package-centric with limited extensibility
- **V2 Format**: Resource-centric with generic resource support
- **Backward Compatibility**: V1 readers still work, V2 includes packages section

### Hook System Architecture
- **Command Execution**: Shell command execution with context timeout
- **Error Handling**: Configurable fail-fast vs continue-on-error
- **Timeout Management**: Per-hook timeout configuration
- **Integration Points**: Pre-sync and post-sync execution phases

### Resource Abstraction
- **Unified Interface**: All resources (packages, dotfiles, future types) use same interface
- **Generic Tracking**: Resources stored with type, ID, state, and metadata
- **Extensible Design**: Easy to add new resource types in future

## Risk Mitigations Implemented

1. **✅ Breaking Lock Compatibility**:
   - Reader supports both v1 and v2 formats
   - Automatic migration preserves all data
   - Backward compatibility maintained

2. **✅ Hook Security**:
   - Only run user-configured commands
   - No arbitrary code execution
   - Shell execution through controlled interface

3. **✅ Hook Failures**:
   - Default fail-fast behavior
   - Optional continue-on-error per hook
   - Proper error propagation and logging

4. **✅ Migration Issues**:
   - All migrations logged for user visibility
   - Comprehensive test coverage
   - Data preservation verified

## Future-Ready Foundation

The implementation creates a solid foundation for AI Lab features:

### Resource Extensibility
- Generic ResourceEntry supports any future resource type
- Metadata field allows resource-specific data storage
- Easy to add docker-compose, systemd services, etc.

### Hook Extensibility
- Hook system can be extended with new phases
- Custom hook types can be added
- Integration points clearly defined

### Lock File Evolution
- Version field supports future format changes
- Generic structure accommodates new features
- Migration framework established

## Code Quality Metrics

- **New Files**: 6 files created
- **Modified Files**: 3 files updated
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive unit tests for all business logic
- **No Breaking Changes**: Full backward compatibility maintained
- **Migration Safety**: Zero data loss, automatic conversion

## Success Criteria Met

- [x] Lock v2 schema implemented and tested
- [x] Automatic v1→v2 migration works
- [x] Hook system executes pre/post sync
- [x] All existing functionality preserved
- [x] Tests pass with no regressions
- [x] Clear foundation for future resources

## Next Steps

Phase 5 has successfully prepared plonk for AI Lab integration. The extensible lock format and hook system provide the necessary infrastructure for future enhancements while maintaining the reliability and simplicity that users expect.

The codebase is now ready for Phase 6 AI Lab features with:
- Resource abstraction in place
- Hook system for AI workflow integration
- Extensible lock format for AI-generated resources
- Backward compatibility ensuring smooth user experience
