# Plonk Code Review

## 1. Executive Summary

This review of the `plonk` codebase, while acknowledging its youth and recent refactoring, identifies several key areas for architectural refinement. The project has a solid foundation with a clear separation of concerns (config, state, managers), but there are significant opportunities to reduce code duplication, clarify responsibilities, and improve internal consistency.

The most critical recommendations are:
1.  **Unify Command Logic:** Abstract the common patterns in `add`, `install`, `rm`, and `uninstall` into a more generic command structure to eliminate redundant code.
2.  **Centralize Configuration Loading:** Create a single, clear mechanism for loading and accessing configuration that is used consistently across all commands.
3.  **Refine the `operations` Package:** Expand the `internal/operations` package to be a true shared services layer, handling more of the cross-cutting concerns like progress reporting and result processing.
4.  **Streamline Output Generation:** Consolidate output formatting logic to ensure a consistent user experience across all commands and output formats (table, JSON, YAML).

Addressing these points will lead to a more maintainable, extensible, and robust codebase, which is crucial for the project's long-term health.

## 2. High-Level Architectural Observations

-   **Strong Foundation:** The core architectural pattern of separating `config`, `state`, `managers`, and `commands` is sound. The use of interfaces in the `config` and `managers` layers is a good practice that will facilitate future extensions.
-   **Clear State Reconciliation:** The `internal/state` package provides a clear and effective abstraction for state reconciliation, which is central to `plonk`'s functionality.
-   **Inconsistent Abstraction in `commands`:** The `internal/commands` layer, however, shows signs of rapid, iterative development. There is a significant amount of duplicated logic, particularly in how commands are structured, how flags are parsed, and how results are handled. This is a prime area for refactoring.

## 3. Detailed Findings and Recommendations

### 3.1. Command Structure and Duplication

**Observation:** There is substantial code duplication across the `add`, `install`, `rm`, and `uninstall` commands. Each command has its own `run...` function that performs similar steps:
-   Parsing flags.
-   Loading configuration.
-   Initializing services (like the lock file service).
-   Iterating over arguments.
-   Calling a processing function for each item.
-   Reporting progress and summarizing results.

**Recommendation:**
-   **Create a Generic Command Runner:** Abstract this common workflow into a higher-level function or a struct that can be configured for each command. This would centralize the boilerplate and leave only the core business logic in each command's specific implementation.
-   **Use Cobra's `PersistentPreRunE`:** For tasks like loading configuration that are common to many commands, use `PersistentPreRunE` on a parent command (like `rootCmd` or a new `packageCmd`) to avoid repeating this logic in every `RunE` function.

### 3.2. Configuration Management

**Observation:** Configuration loading is inconsistent. Some commands use `config.LoadConfig`, others use `config.GetOrCreateConfig`, and the `doctor` command has its own logic for checking configuration validity. The `config.ConfigAdapter` and `config.State...Adapter` types add a layer of indirection that could be simplified.

**Recommendation:**
-   **Centralize Config Loading:** Create a single, authoritative way to load and access configuration. This could be a singleton or a context-injected service that is initialized once at the start of the command execution.
-   **Simplify Adapters:** Re-evaluate the need for the various config adapters. It might be possible to have the `config.ResolvedConfig` type directly implement the necessary interfaces for the `state` package, removing the need for intermediate adapter layers.

### 3.3. Error Handling

**Observation:** The structured error system in `internal/errors` is a strong point. However, its application is not entirely consistent. The `commands/errors.go` file contains helper functions that are useful but also indicate that error handling at the command level could be more standardized.

**Recommendation:**
-   **Standardize Command Error Returns:** All `RunE` functions should return a `*errors.PlonkError`. This will allow for a single, centralized error handling function (as is partially implemented in `HandleError`) to manage all output and exit codes.
-   **Enrich Error Context:** Make more liberal use of the `.With...` methods on `PlonkError` to add contextual information (like the item being processed) to errors. This will make debugging and user feedback more effective.

### 3.4. Output Formatting

**Observation:** The logic for generating `table`, `json`, and `yaml` output is spread across multiple files and types. Each command that produces output has its own set of structs and `TableOutput()` methods. This leads to inconsistencies in the look and feel of the output.

**Recommendation:**
-   **Create a Centralized `output` Package:** Move all output-related structs and formatting logic into a new `internal/output` package. This package would define a standard way to render different types of data (e.g., lists of packages, status summaries).
-   **Use a Standard `Render` Function:** A single `Render(data interface{}, format string)` function in the `output` package could take any data structure and format it correctly, using type assertions or interfaces to determine how to render it.

### 3.5. `internal/operations` Package

**Observation:** The `internal/operations` package is a good start for abstracting shared logic, but it could be used more extensively. Currently, it mainly contains types and progress reporting.

**Recommendation:**
-   **Expand its Role:** Move more of the shared workflow logic into this package. For example, the logic for processing a batch of items (packages or dotfiles) could be a generic function in `operations` that takes a processing function as an argument.
-   **Generic Progress Reporter:** The `DefaultProgressReporter` can be made more generic to handle different types of operations beyond just "add" and "remove".

## 4. Specific Code-Level Suggestions

-   **`commands/shared.go`:** This file is a good candidate for refactoring. The `applyPackages` and `applyDotfiles` functions contain logic that is very similar to what's in the `install` and `add` commands. This further highlights the need for a unified command execution flow.
-   **`doctor` command:** The `doctor` command is well-structured but performs many checks that could be exposed as individual, reusable functions in the relevant packages (e.g., a `CheckAvailability()` function in the `managers` package).
-   **`config/yaml_config.go`:** The `shouldSkipDotfile` function has a complex set of rules. This could be simplified and is a good candidate for more extensive unit testing to cover all edge cases.
-   **Redundant Types:** There are several similar "output" and "result" types across the `commands` and `operations` packages (e.g., `PackageApplyResult`, `EnhancedPackageOutput`, `OperationResult`). These could be consolidated into a more unified set of data structures.

## 5. Conclusion

The `plonk` project is off to a great start. The current architecture is functional and has clear potential. The recommendations in this review are intended to help the project mature by reducing technical debt, improving maintainability, and creating a more robust and consistent internal design.

By focusing on abstracting common command logic, centralizing configuration and output handling, and expanding the role of the `operations` package, `plonk` can evolve into a powerful and well-engineered tool.
