# TASK 007 COMPLETION REPORT - Delete Core Package

## Summary
Successfully deleted the `core` package and relocated all business logic to appropriate domain packages. The task required additional architectural adjustments to resolve an import cycle that was exposed during the refactoring.

## What Was Moved Where

### 1. Dotfile Operations → Commands Package
**Functions moved to `internal/commands/dotfile_operations.go`:**
- `AddSingleDotfile()` - Process single dotfile path
- `AddSingleFile()` - Process single file
- `AddDirectoryFiles()` - Process directory contents
- `RemoveSingleDotfile()` - Remove dotfile from management
- `ProcessDotfileForApply()` - Apply dotfile operations

**Types moved:**
- `ProcessDotfileForApplyOptions`
- `ProcessDotfileForApplyResult`

**Reason:** These functions orchestrate business logic between multiple domains (state, config, dotfiles) and are primarily used by command handlers. Moving them to the commands package resolves the import cycle and follows Go best practices.

### 2. Package Utilities → Managers Package
**Function moved to `internal/managers/goinstall.go`:**
- `ExtractBinaryNameFromPath()` - Extract binary name from Go module path

**Reason:** This utility is specific to Go package management and belongs with the Go package manager implementation.

### 3. Factory Functions → Inlined/Removed
- `LoadOrCreateConfig()` - Inlined in `commands/add.go` (was just a 2-line wrapper)
- `CreatePackageProvider()` - Not used by commands, left for runtime context
- `CreateDotfileProvider()` - Not used by commands, left for runtime context

## Import Update Count
Updated imports in 5 command files:
1. `add.go` - Changed from using `core` and `dotfiles` imports to local functions
2. `rm.go` - Changed from using `core` and `dotfiles` imports to local functions
3. `install.go` - Changed from using `core` to `managers` for ExtractBinaryNameFromPath
4. `uninstall.go` - Changed from using `core` to `managers` for ExtractBinaryNameFromPath
5. `sync.go` - Changed from using `core` and `dotfiles` imports to local functions

## Architectural Issue Resolution
### Problem Discovered
Moving functions from `core` to `dotfiles` created an import cycle:
- `dotfiles` → `state` (for OperationResult type)
- `state` → `dotfiles` (for dotfile provider)

### Solution Implemented
Moved the orchestration functions to the `commands` package instead, which:
- Already imports both `state` and `dotfiles`
- Is the natural location for business logic orchestration
- Keeps functions close to their primary usage
- Breaks the import cycle completely

## Test Results
✅ All unit tests passing: `go test ./...`
✅ Integration tests passing: `just test`
✅ No import cycles detected
✅ No remaining references to core package: verified with `grep -r "internal/core"`

## Package Count Reduction
✅ Successfully reduced package count from 14 to 13 packages:
- Deleted: `internal/core`
- Remaining: commands, config, dotfiles, errors, lock, managers, managers/parsers, mocks, paths, runtime, state, testing, ui

## Key Insights
1. The `core` package was serving as a business logic orchestration layer that prevented import cycles
2. When deleting such packages, orchestration logic should move to the consuming layer (commands), not deeper into domain packages
3. The refactoring exposed a pre-existing tight coupling between `state` and `dotfiles` packages that was hidden by the core package abstraction

## Conclusion
Task 007 completed successfully. The core package has been eliminated with all functionality preserved and properly relocated. The codebase is now cleaner with one less abstraction layer, and all business logic resides in appropriate domain-specific locations.
