# Plonk Codebase Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This audit of the plonk codebase identified several areas for improvement including duplicate interfaces, inconsistent error handling patterns, and opportunities for code consolidation. No critical missing functions were found, and the codebase appears largely complete with all major features implemented.

## 1. Duplicate Functionality

### Duplicate Interface Definitions

The following interfaces are defined in multiple locations:

**Config Interfaces** (duplicated between `internal/config/interfaces.go` and `internal/interfaces/config.go`):
- `ConfigReader`
- `ConfigWriter`
- `ConfigValidator`
- `ConfigService`
- `DotfileConfigLoader`

**Operations Interfaces** (duplicated between `internal/operations/types.go` and `internal/interfaces/operations.go`):
- `BatchProcessor`
- `ProgressReporter`

### Recommendations:
1. Complete the interface consolidation by removing duplicates from `internal/config/interfaces.go` and `internal/operations/types.go`
2. Update all references to use the unified interfaces from `internal/interfaces/`
3. Remove the temporary adapters once migration is complete

## 2. Incomplete Implementations

### Partially Complete Features

**1. Generic Output in CommandPipeline**
- Location: `internal/commands/pipeline.go`
- Issue: Table format not implemented for generic output
- Code: `return "Generic output (table format not implemented)"`

**2. Panic Methods in YAML Config**
- Location: `internal/config/yaml_config.go`
- Issue: Methods panic instead of returning proper errors
- Methods:
  - `GetDotfileTargets()` - panics with message to use DotfileConfigAdapter
  - `GetPackagesForManager()` - panics with message to use PackageConfigAdapter

### Recommendations:
1. Implement proper table formatting for generic output
2. Refactor the YAML config to properly implement interfaces or remove these methods

## 3. Inconsistent Error Handling

### Use of fmt.Errorf Instead of errors.Wrap

Found 15 instances of `fmt.Errorf` usage that should use the plonk error system:

**Files violating error handling guidelines:**
- `internal/config/simple_validator.go` (5 instances)
- `internal/config/yaml_config.go` (1 instance)
- `internal/managers/parsers/parsers.go` (1 instance)
- `internal/state/reconciler.go` (4 instances)
- `internal/state/adapters.go` (1 instance)

### Recommendations:
1. Replace all `fmt.Errorf` calls with appropriate `errors.NewError` or `errors.Wrap` calls
2. Add appropriate error codes and domains
3. Include suggestion messages where helpful

## 4. Technical Debt

### TODO Comments

Found 2 TODO comments indicating planned improvements:

1. **ManagerAdapter TODO** (`internal/state/adapters.go`):
   - "This adapter can be removed once all code directly uses interfaces.PackageManager"
   - Indicates ongoing interface migration

2. **Multiple Installations TODO** (`internal/commands/info.go`):
   - "Use the first location found (TODO: handle multiple installations)"
   - Package info command doesn't handle packages installed by multiple managers

### Recommendations:
1. Complete the interface migration and remove ManagerAdapter
2. Implement proper handling for packages installed by multiple managers

## 5. Orphaned Code

### Potentially Unused Constructors

All constructor functions appear to be used. No orphaned constructors were found.

### Unused Exports

No significant orphaned exports were identified. The codebase appears well-maintained with minimal dead code.

## 6. Missing Functions

### StandardBatchWorkflow

The `StandardBatchWorkflow` function exists and is properly used:
- Defined in: `internal/operations/batch.go`
- Used by: `rm`, `uninstall`, and `install` commands

No missing function implementations were found.

## 7. Architecture Observations

### Positive Patterns
1. **Consistent use of interfaces** - Good separation of concerns
2. **Comprehensive test coverage** - Most components have corresponding test files
3. **Clear package boundaries** - Well-organized internal structure
4. **Adapter pattern** - Properly used to prevent circular dependencies

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Interface consolidation** - Complete the migration to unified interfaces
2. **Error handling consistency** - Standardize on plonk's error system
3. **Config method organization** - Resolve the panic methods in YAML config

## 8. Package Manager Completeness

All package managers appear complete with full implementations:
- APT ✓ (Linux only, properly handles OS check)
- Homebrew ✓
- NPM ✓
- Cargo ✓
- Gem ✓
- Pip ✓
- Go Install ✓

Each manager properly implements:
- IsAvailable with graceful degradation
- Install/Uninstall operations
- List/Search/Info operations
- Version detection
- Error pattern matching

## Recommendations Summary

### High Priority
1. Complete interface consolidation - remove duplicates from config and operations packages
2. Fix all fmt.Errorf usage to use plonk's error handling system
3. Resolve panic methods in yaml_config.go

### Medium Priority
1. Implement table formatting for generic command output
2. Handle multiple package manager installations in info command
3. Remove ManagerAdapter after migration complete

### Low Priority
1. Add more comprehensive error messages with suggestions
2. Document the adapter pattern usage in code comments
3. Consider adding a linter rule to prevent fmt.Errorf usage

## Conclusion

The plonk codebase is well-structured and largely complete. The main issues identified are related to ongoing refactoring efforts (interface consolidation) and consistency improvements (error handling). No critical missing functionality was found, and all major features appear to be properly implemented. The codebase follows good architectural patterns with clear separation of concerns and comprehensive test coverage.
