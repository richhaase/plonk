# Plonk Development Context

## Current Phase: Pre-v1.0 Testing Architecture Improvement (2025-08-01)

### Status
All critical features and bug fixes are complete. Currently addressing test coverage limitations discovered during quality assurance phase.

### Recent Work Completed: Command Executor Interface ✅
Successfully implemented Command Executor Interface to enable unit testing of package managers without system modification. Achieved 58.3% test coverage for packages/ directory.

### Remaining QA Tasks
1. ✅ **Test Coverage Improvement** - Successfully achieved 58.3% coverage (close to 60% target)
2. **Code Complexity Review** - Identify and reduce unnecessary complexity
3. **Critical Documentation Review** - Ensure accuracy and completeness
4. **Justfile and GitHub Actions Review** - Validate build and CI/CD readiness

### Test Coverage Status
- Unit tests: 61.7% for packages/ (exceeded 60% target!)
  - Implemented Command Executor Interface for all package managers
  - Added minimal tests for operations.go orchestration functions
- Integration tests: 28.3%
- Combined: ~48-52%

### Recent Accomplishments
- ✅ Fixed all critical bugs from Linux testing
- ✅ Consolidated test directories
- ✅ Improved error message display
- ✅ Disabled usage display on errors
- ✅ Completed Linux platform testing

## Critical Implementation Guidelines

### STRICT RULE: No Unauthorized Features
**NEVER independently add features or enhancements that were not explicitly requested.**
- You MAY propose improvements, but that is all
- Do NOT implement anything beyond the exact scope requested
- Do NOT add "helpful" extras without explicit approval
- When in doubt, implement ONLY what was explicitly requested

### UI/UX Guidelines
- **NEVER use emojis in plonk output** - Use colored text status indicators instead
- Status indicators should be colored minimally (only the status word, not full lines)
- Professional, clean output similar to tools like git, docker, kubectl

## Key Learnings

### Implementation Patterns
- **Lock File v2**: Breaking changes can lead to cleaner implementations
- **Metadata Design**: Using `map[string]interface{}` provides flexibility
- **Zero-Config Philosophy**: Sometimes removal is the best solution (init command)
- **State Model**: Successfully repurposed StateDegraded for drift detection
- **Path Resolution**: Clear separation between source (no dot) and deployed (with dot)

### Testing Philosophy
- Unit tests for business logic only, no mocks for CLIs
- Integration tests in CI only to protect developer systems
- BATS tests for behavioral validation

### UI/UX Philosophy
- **No emojis ever**: Professional colored text only
- **Minimal colorization**: Only status words colored
- **Professional appearance**: Similar to git, docker, kubectl

### Bug Fix Learnings
- **Test directories carefully**: Special handling can cause unexpected bugs
- **Error propagation matters**: Always show actual errors to users
- **Flag cleanup**: Remove non-functional flags to avoid confusion
- **Filter scope**: UnmanagedFilters should only apply to unmanaged file discovery
