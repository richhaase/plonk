# Plonk - Shell Environment Lifecycle Manager

## Project Overview

Plonk is a CLI tool for managing shell environments across multiple machines. It helps you manage package installations and environment switching using a focused set of package managers:

- **Homebrew** - Primary package installation
- **ASDF** - Programming language tools and versions
- **NPM** - Packages not available via Homebrew (like claude-code)

## Development Approach

This project was developed using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** with Red-Green-Refactor cycles throughout the implementation.

## Architecture

### Package Managers (`pkg/managers/`)
- **CommandExecutor Interface** - Abstraction for command execution (supports dependency injection)
- **CommandRunner** - Shared command execution logic to eliminate code duplication
- **Individual Managers** - Homebrew, ASDF, NPM with consistent interfaces

### Configuration Management (`pkg/config/`)
- **YAML-First Design** - Primary config format with TOML legacy support
- **Package-Centric Structure** - Organized by package manager with dotfiles section
- **Source-Target Convention** - Automatic path mapping (config/nvim/ â†’ ~/.config/nvim/)
- **Local Overrides** - Support for plonk.local.yaml for machine-specific settings

### CLI (`internal/commands/`)
- **Cobra Framework** - Professional CLI with help, autocompletion, and subcommands
- **Status Command** - Shows availability and package counts for all managers
- **Pkg Command** - Modular package listing with `plonk pkg list [manager]` structure

### Testing
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage** - All components tested with TDD approach
- **Mock Command Executor** - Enables testing without actual command execution
- **Interface Compliance Tests** - Ensures consistent behavior across managers
- **Config Validation Tests** - YAML/TOML parsing and validation coverage

```bash
go build ./cmd/plonk
```

### Commands
```bash
./plonk --help                   # Show main help
./plonk status                   # Package manager availability and counts
./plonk pkg list                 # List packages from all managers

```

### Example Output
```
Package Manager Status
=====================

## Homebrew
âœ… Available
ðŸ“¦ 139 packages installed

## Configuration Format

The new YAML-based configuration supports both simple and complex package definitions:

```yaml

  default_manager: homebrew

# Standalone config files (no package install needed)
dotfiles:
  - zshrc                    # -> ~/.zshrc
  - zshenv                   # -> ~/.zshenv
  - plugins.zsh              # -> ~/.plugins.zsh

1. **Go Over Rust/Python** - Better balance of simplicity and power for CLI tools
2. **Test-Driven Development** - Ensures reliability and maintainability
3. **CommandRunner Abstraction** - Eliminates code duplication across managers
4. **Interface-Based Design** - Easy to add new package managers or mock for testing
