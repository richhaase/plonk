## Progress Log

### Session 1 - Initial Review
- Created this tracking document
- Identified review areas based on codebase analysis

### Session 1 - Comprehensive Testing
- Tested zero-config behavior from clean slate
- Tested package management (add, remove, list, search, info)
- Tested dotfile management (list, add, apply)
- Tested configuration commands (init, show, validate, edit)
- Tested error conditions and edge cases
- Tested all output formats (table, JSON, YAML)
- Tested doctor command health checks

### Session 1 - Issues Found and Fixed

#### Issue #1: JSON/YAML Output Verbosity
**Status:** ✅ FIXED (via linting)
**Description:** `plonk status --output json/yaml` shows every single untracked file with full metadata (397 items), making output extremely verbose and unusable
**Expected:** Should have summary format like table output, with option for full details
**Fix:** Linter automatically improved JSON structure to show summary with domain counts instead of listing all untracked items
**Location:** Status command output formatting

#### Issue #2: Config Valid Field Misleading  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED (via linting)
**Description:** `config_valid: false` in JSON output when no config file exists is misleading
**Expected:** Should be `null` or separate field indicating "no config file"
**Fix:** Now correctly shows `config_valid: true` when valid config exists, and properly distinguishes between invalid vs missing config
**Location:** Status command JSON output

#### Issue #3: Lock File Treated as Missing Dotfile
**Status:** ✅ FIXED
**Description:** `plonk.lock` is treated as a dotfile that should be managed, showing as "missing" in status
**Expected:** Lock file should be ignored by default as it's program-generated
**Fix:** Added `plonk.lock` to default ignore patterns in `defaults.go`
**Location:** Dotfile discovery system

#### Issue #4: Default Ignore Patterns Missing Lock File
**Status:** ✅ FIXED
**Description:** `plonk.lock` should be in default ignore patterns but isn't
**Expected:** Lock file patterns should be ignored by default
**Fix:** Added `plonk.lock` to default ignore patterns in `defaults.go`
**Location:** Default ignore patterns

#### Issue #5: Config Show Field Name Formatting
**Status:** ✅ FIXED
**Description:** `plonk config show` outputs malformed field names (`defaultmanager` instead of `default_manager`)
**Expected:** Proper field names with underscores
**Fix:** Added YAML/JSON struct tags to `ResolvedConfig` struct in `resolved.go`
**Location:** Config show command YAML output

#### Issue #6: Apply Command Also Affects Lock File
**Status:** ✅ FIXED
**Description:** `plonk apply` also tries to deploy the lock file as a dotfile, related to Issues #3 and #4
**Expected:** Lock file should be ignored completely
**Fix:** Fixed by adding `plonk.lock` to default ignore patterns (same fix as Issues #3 and #4)
**Location:** Apply command and dotfile discovery

#### Issue #7: Package Installation False Success
**Status:** ✅ FIXED
**Description:** `plonk pkg add` reports successful installation of nonexistent packages, adding them to lock file without actually installing
**Expected:** Should fail with clear error message when package doesn't exist
**Location:** Package manager installation logic (Homebrew manager)
**Fix:** Removed overly broad `Warning:` check in `homebrew.go:84`, now only handles "already installed" case specifically
**Test:** `plonk pkg add nonexistent-package-12345` now correctly reports error

## Summary of Fixes Applied

### Files Modified
1. **`internal/config/defaults.go`** - Added `plonk.lock` to default ignore patterns
2. **`internal/config/resolved.go`** - Added YAML/JSON struct tags for proper field naming  
3. **`internal/managers/homebrew.go`** - Fixed overly broad warning check that caused false success reports
4. **`internal/config/zero_config_test.go`** - Updated test to expect 6 ignore patterns instead of 5

### All Critical Issues Resolved
- ✅ **Lock file no longer treated as dotfile** (Issues #3, #4, #6)
- ✅ **Package installation error handling fixed** (Issue #7 - Critical)
- ✅ **Config show field formatting corrected** (Issue #5)  
- ✅ **JSON/YAML output verbosity improved** (Issues #1, #2)
- ✅ **All tests passing**
- ✅ **Pre-commit checks passing**

### Session 1 - Final Validation
- **Clean slate test**: Verified zero-config behavior works perfectly
- **Package workflow**: Add → Status → Remove → Re-add cycle works flawlessly  
- **Error handling**: Nonexistent packages properly rejected with clear messages
- **Config management**: Init → Show → Validate → Edit cycle works correctly
- **Output consistency**: Table, JSON, and YAML formats all provide appropriate detail levels
- **State accuracy**: No false missing items, accurate managed/untracked counts

### Positive Behaviors Confirmed
- Error handling for invalid package managers works well
- Config validation provides clear error messages  
- Doctor command provides comprehensive health checks
- State reconciliation correctly identifies missing vs managed items
- Dotfile deployment works correctly
- Package removal works correctly
- Search command correctly identifies nonexistent packages
- Info command provides good package details
- JSON output formatting is clean and structured
- Zero-config experience is seamless and intuitive
- Apply command dry-run accurately previews changes
- Lock file automatically managed without user intervention
