# Plonk Development Context

## Current Phase: Ready for v1.0 Release (2025-08-01)

### Status
All critical features, bug fixes, and quality assurance tasks are complete. The codebase is ready for v1.0 release.

### Completed QA Tasks ✅
1. **Test Coverage Improvement** - Successfully achieved 61.7% coverage for packages/ (exceeded 60% target)
2. **Code Complexity Review** - Completed analysis, found acceptable for v1.0
3. **Critical Documentation Review** - Fixed outdated command references
4. **Justfile and GitHub Actions Review** - Cleaned up unused features, improved security workflow

### Recent Work Completed
- ✅ **Command Executor Interface** - Implemented for all package managers
- ✅ **Test Coverage Improvement** - Achieved 61.7% for packages/ (up from 21.7%)
- ✅ **Code Complexity Review** - Analyzed 105 Go files, identified refactoring opportunities for post-v1.0
- ✅ **Critical Documentation Review** - Fixed outdated references to defunct commands
- ✅ **Justfile and GitHub Actions Review** - Removed unused features, improved security coverage

### Test Architecture Improvement Summary
- **Problem**: Package managers were tightly coupled to exec.Command, preventing unit testing
- **Solution**: Implemented Command Executor Interface pattern
- **Result**: Achieved 61.7% test coverage for packages/ without system modification
- **Documentation**: See docs/planning/COMMAND_EXECUTOR_INTERFACE_PLAN.md

### Code Complexity Review Summary
- **Analyzed**: 105 Go files, 19,337 lines of code, 3,860 total complexity
- **Found**: 7 functions >100 lines, duplicate patterns in validation/error handling
- **Recommendation**: NO refactoring before v1.0 - code is stable and well-tested
- **Documentation**: See docs/planning/code-complexity-review.md for post-v1.0 roadmap

### Critical Documentation Review Summary
- **Found**: Outdated references to defunct `setup` and `init` commands in README
- **Fixed**: Updated README.md to use correct `clone` command
- **Status**: Documentation ready for v1.0 (stability warning to be removed when tagging)
- **Documentation**: See docs/planning/documentation-review.md for full analysis

### Justfile and GitHub Actions Review Summary
- **Removed**: Non-existent generate-mocks reference and unused release commands
- **Updated**: Security workflow to run on main branch, CI matrix to Go 1.23/1.24
- **Kept**: Go 1.23 requirement (needed by tool dependencies), tools.go pattern
- **Documentation**: See docs/planning/justfile-github-actions-review.md for details

## Critical Implementation Guidelines

### STRICT RULE: No Unauthorized Features
**NEVER independently add features or enhancements that were not explicitly requested.**
- You MAY propose improvements, but that is all
- Do NOT implement anything beyond the exact scope requested
- Do NOT add "helpful" extras without explicit approval
- When in doubt, implement ONLY what was explicitly requested

### UI/UX Guidelines
- **NEVER use emojis in plonk output** - Use colored text status indicators instead
- Status indicators should be colored minimally (only the status word, not full lines)
- Professional, clean output similar to tools like git, docker, kubectl

## Key Learnings

### Implementation Patterns
- **Lock File v2**: Breaking changes can lead to cleaner implementations
- **Metadata Design**: Using `map[string]interface{}` provides flexibility
- **Zero-Config Philosophy**: Sometimes removal is the best solution (init command)
- **State Model**: Successfully repurposed StateDegraded for drift detection
- **Path Resolution**: Clear separation between source (no dot) and deployed (with dot)

### Testing Philosophy
- Unit tests for business logic only, no mocks for CLIs
- Integration tests in CI only to protect developer systems
- BATS tests for behavioral validation

### UI/UX Philosophy
- **No emojis ever**: Professional colored text only
- **Minimal colorization**: Only status words colored
- **Professional appearance**: Similar to git, docker, kubectl

### Bug Fix Learnings
- **Test directories carefully**: Special handling can cause unexpected bugs
- **Error propagation matters**: Always show actual errors to users
- **Flag cleanup**: Remove non-functional flags to avoid confusion
- **Filter scope**: UnmanagedFilters should only apply to unmanaged file discovery
