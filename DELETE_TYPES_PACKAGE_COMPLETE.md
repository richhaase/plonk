# Completion Report: Delete Types Package

## Summary
Successfully deleted the `internal/types` package and moved its functionality to the `internal/state` package where it logically belongs.

## What Was Done

1. **Created new file** `internal/state/types.go` containing:
   - `Result` struct - for state reconciliation results
   - `Summary` struct - for aggregate counts
   - Methods: `Count()`, `IsEmpty()`, `AddToSummary()`
   - Changed Item fields to use `interfaces.Item` directly (no aliases)

2. **Updated imports** in 5 files:
   - commands/ls.go - changed types → state
   - commands/shared.go - changed types → state
   - commands/status.go - changed types → state
   - runtime/context.go - removed types import (already had state)
   - runtime/context_simple.go - removed types import (already had state)

3. **Updated type references**:
   - Changed all `types.Result` → `state.Result`
   - Changed all `types.Summary` → `state.Summary`
   - Removed type aliases - now using `interfaces.Item` directly

4. **Deleted** the `internal/types/` directory

## Key Changes
- Removed unnecessary indirection through type aliases
- Placed Result/Summary types where they belong (state package)
- More direct imports - no re-exporting from types package

## Validation Results
- ✅ Build successful: `go build ./...`
- ✅ Unit tests passed: `just test`
- ✅ UX integration tests passed: `just test-ux`

## Package Count
- Before: 21 packages (after cli merge)
- After: 20 packages
- Progress: 2 packages eliminated total
