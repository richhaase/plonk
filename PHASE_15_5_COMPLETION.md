# Phase 15.5 Completion Report

## Overview
Phase 15.5 successfully fixed critical issues introduced by Phase 15 and enhanced the status and info commands for better usability.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Fixed Lint Errors âœ…
- Replaced all instances of `fmt.Errorf(errorMsg)` with `fmt.Errorf("%s", errorMsg)` in:
  - info.go
  - install.go
  - search.go
  - uninstall.go
- This maintains consistency with the rest of the codebase

### 2. Fixed Package Count Issue âœ…
**Problem**: Only 10 packages were showing as managed instead of 59
**Root Cause**: Lock file used "homebrew" but registry used "brew"
**Solution**: Added normalization in reconcile.go to convert "homebrew" â†’ "brew"

### 3. Fixed Dotfile Count Issue âœ…
**Problem**: Only 6 dotfiles were showing as managed instead of 22
**Root Cause**:
- `GetConfiguredDotfiles()` was incorrectly setting state before reconciliation
- `Actual()` method was scanning home for dotfiles instead of checking specific files
**Solution**:
- Removed state assignment from `GetConfiguredDotfiles()`
- Rewrote `Actual()` to check each desired file's existence

### 4. Enhanced Status Command Output âœ…
- Changed from minimal summary to detailed listing of all managed items
- Displays packages and dotfiles as separate, properly formatted tables
- Added `--packages` and `--dotfiles` flags to filter output
- Removed `--health` and `--check` flags (users should use `plonk doctor`)

### 5. Enhanced Info Command âœ…
- Updated to use StandardTableBuilder for consistent formatting
- Properly displays package information in a structured table format
- Shows appropriate status messages and action hints

## Output Examples

## Technical Details

### Key Changes
1. **reconcile.go**: Added manager name normalization
2. **resource.go**: Fixed `Actual()` method in dotfile resource
3. **status.go**: Complete rewrite of `TableOutput()` method
4. **info.go**: Replaced custom formatting with StandardTableBuilder

### Stats
- Fixed: 2 major reconciliation bugs
- Enhanced: 2 command outputs
- Removed: 2 unnecessary flags
- Lines changed: ~400

## Testing
All changes were tested with:
- `plonk status` - Shows all 76 managed items correctly
- `plonk status --packages` - Shows only packages
- `plonk status --dotfiles` - Shows only dotfiles
- `plonk info <package>` - Shows proper formatted info for all states

## Summary
Phase 15.5 successfully restored the intended functionality of the status command while improving the overall user experience with better formatted output and proper filtering options.
