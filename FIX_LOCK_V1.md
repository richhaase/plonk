# Critical Fix: Init Command Creating v1 Lock File

## Issue
The `plonk init` command is creating a v1 format lock file, but the entire codebase has been migrated to v2 format. This creates an immediate incompatibility where:
1. User runs `plonk init` → creates v1 lock file
2. User tries to install packages → v2 code reads v1 file
3. Error: "unsupported lock file version 1 (expected 2)"

## Location
File: `internal/setup/setup.go`
Function: `createDefaultConfig()` (around line 201)

## Current Incorrect Code
```go
// Create empty plonk.lock file
lockPath := filepath.Join(plonkDir, "plonk.lock")
lockContent := `# Plonk Lock File
# This file tracks the exact versions of packages and dotfiles managed by plonk.
# Do not edit this file manually - it is maintained automatically by plonk.

version: 1
packages: {}
dotfiles: {}
`
```

## Required Fix
Replace with v2 format:
```go
// Create empty plonk.lock file
lockPath := filepath.Join(plonkDir, "plonk.lock")
lockContent := `# Plonk Lock File
# This file tracks the exact versions of packages and dotfiles managed by plonk.
# Do not edit this file manually - it is maintained automatically by plonk.

version: 2
resources: []
`
```

## Why This Is Critical
1. **Breaks New User Experience**: First command after init will fail
2. **Inconsistent with Codebase**: All lock reading/writing code expects v2
3. **No Migration Path**: v1 support was completely removed

## Testing
After fixing, test:
1. Run `plonk init` in a fresh directory
2. Verify plonk.lock has `version: 2` and `resources: []`
3. Run `plonk install brew:htop` - should work without version errors
4. Verify the lock file is updated with v2 resource entries

## Additional Notes
- The YAML comment can stay the same
- Empty resources should be `[]` not `{}` (array not map)
- This is the ONLY place in the codebase creating a v1 lock file
