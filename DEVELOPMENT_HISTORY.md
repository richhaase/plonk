# Plonk Development Guidelines

## Development Rules

### Error Handling
- **Always use plonk's error handling** - `errors.Wrap()` not `fmt.Errorf()`
- **Package manager availability** - Return `(false, nil)` not error when binary missing
- **Structured errors** - Use appropriate error codes and domains for user-friendly messages

### Testing & Quality
- **Test before release** - Run `just precommit` before any release
- **Graceful degradation** - Features should fail gracefully (e.g., unavailable package managers)
- **Context everywhere** - All long-running operations must accept context for cancellation

### Developer Experience
- **Zero-config first** - Features must work without configuration
- **One-command setup** - New developers should be productive with `just dev-setup`
- **Fast feedback loops** - Use pre-commit framework for file-specific checks (94% faster)

### Build & Release
- **Binary location** - Output to `bin/` not `build/`
- **Automated releases** - Use GoReleaser via `just release-auto`
- **Composite actions** - Reuse GitHub Actions for consistency

## Completed Work Summary

### Session 1: Core Functionality Fixes
- Fixed 7 critical issues including:
  - JSON/YAML output verbosity
  - Lock file being treated as dotfile
  - Package installation false success reports
  - Config field name formatting
- All issues resolved without breaking changes

### Session 2: Automation & Developer Experience

#### Release Process
- Replaced custom release with GoReleaser
- Added GitHub Actions workflow for automated releases
- Fixed package manager availability checks

#### Pre-commit Framework
- Migrated from shell scripts to pre-commit framework
- 94% performance improvement on non-Go changes
- Removed all legacy hook infrastructure

#### CI/CD Improvements
- Created composite actions (50% complexity reduction)
- Eliminated 60+ lines of duplicated justfile code
- Standardized Go environment setup across workflows

#### Developer Commands
- `just dev-setup` - Complete environment setup in one command
- `just deps-update` - Safe dependency updates with validation
- `just clean-all` - Deep clean including all caches

#### Build Standardization
- Changed output directory from `build/` to `bin/`
- Updated all documentation and scripts

### Session 3: Multiple Add Interface Enhancement

#### Core Implementation (Phases 0-2)
- Enhanced package manager interface with version support (`GetInstalledVersion()`)
- Created shared operations utilities (`internal/operations/`) for batch processing
- Extended error system with contextual suggestions and helpful guidance
- Implemented multiple package add with sequential processing and progress reporting
- Implemented multiple dotfile add with file attribute preservation and directory support
- All functionality maintains full backward compatibility

#### Technical Achievements
- **Filesystem-based dotfile detection** - Discovered and leveraged plonk's auto-discovery approach
- **Continue-on-failure strategy** - Process all items with comprehensive error reporting
- **Version tracking** - Enhanced UX with package version display in progress
- **Shared utilities pattern** - Reusable components for future batch operations
- **Comprehensive testing** - Full test coverage with isolated environments

#### User Experience Delivered
- **Multiple package add**: `plonk pkg add git neovim ripgrep htop`
- **Multiple dotfile add**: `plonk dot add ~/.vimrc ~/.zshrc ~/.gitconfig`
- **Mixed operations**: `plonk dot add ~/.config/nvim/ ~/.tmux.conf`
- **Dry-run support**: Preview mode for all multiple operations
- **Progress feedback**: Real-time status with version information

#### Documentation Excellence (Phase 3)
- Updated CLI.md with comprehensive multiple add examples and syntax
- Enhanced README.md with practical bulk operation workflows
- Verified command help text accuracy and completeness
- Validated all documented examples work as described

### Key Achievements
- ðŸš€ 2-minute developer onboarding
- âš¡ 94% faster pre-commit hooks
- ðŸ”§ Modern CI/CD with reusable components
- ðŸ“¦ Automated multi-platform releases
- ðŸ§¹ Cleaner, more maintainable codebase
- âœ¨ Multiple add functionality with excellent UX
- ðŸŽ¯ Complete feature delivery with comprehensive documentation

### Next Steps
- Symlink behavior investigation (deferred)
- Unicode path support
- Network failure handling
- Performance benchmarking
