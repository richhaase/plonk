# Changelog

All notable changes to the Plonk project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Complete Package Management UI** with `plonk pkg list [all|managed|missing|untracked]` and `plonk pkg status`
- **Complete Dotfiles Management UI** with `plonk dot list [all|managed|missing|untracked]` and `plonk dot status`
- **State Reconciliation Architecture** - StateReconciler, ConfigLoader, and VersionChecker for comparing config vs installed packages
- **Ultra-simple Dotfiles Implementation** - ~100 lines total using same patterns as package management
- **Machine-friendly Output Formats** - Global `--output/-o` flag supporting table (default), JSON, and YAML formats
- **Manager-specific Version Logic** - Homebrew ignores versions, ASDF/NPM require exact version matches
- **Unified CLI structure** with concept-specific commands (`plonk pkg`, `plonk dot`, future `plonk config`)
- **Justfile development workflow** replacing dev.go with just commands (build, test, lint, format, security, clean, install, precommit)
- **Simplified package managers** - Drastically simplified with minimal interface (IsAvailable, ListInstalled)

### Changed
- **CLI architecture** - Replaced monolithic status command with focused concept-specific commands
- **Development workflow** - Migrated from dev.go to justfile for simpler, standard development tasks
- **Package managers** - Simplified from 2,224 lines to ~150 lines, removing all abstraction layers
- **Dotfiles implementation** - Ultra-simplified to ~100 lines using same reconciliation patterns as packages
- **Project structure** - Moved pkg/* to internal/* following Go CLI conventions
- **State reconciliation** - Separated from package managers into dedicated reconciler service

### Fixed
- **Import command configuration path** - Fixed incorrect subdirectory usage that was inconsistent with other commands
- **Performance issues** - Removed slow state-aware methods that were causing hangs
- **Key mapping bug** - Fixed display name vs config name mapping (Homebrew vs homebrew) in reconciler
- **Test compilation** - Removed broken tests relying on deleted abstractions, added basic reconciler tests

### Removed
- **ZSH plugin management** - Removed ZSH plugin management functionality and related tests  
- **Monolithic command layer** - Removed entire internal/commands package (8400+ lines) for focused UI redesign
- **Mixed-concern status command** - Removed original status command that tried to display packages + dotfiles + drift in one view
- **Dev.go task runner** - Replaced with standard justfile for better tool ecosystem fit
- **Unused internal packages** - Removed internal/directories, internal/utils, internal/tasks after command layer removal
- **Over-engineered abstractions** - Removed CommandExecutor, CommandRunner from package managers
- **Complex package manager interface** - Simplified to minimal interface with just 2 methods
- **Broken test files** - Removed manager_test.go that relied on deleted abstractions
