# Completion Report: Delete Constants Package

## Summary
Successfully deleted the `internal/constants` package and moved constants to their logical domain packages where they belong.

## What Was Done

1. **Created new constants files** in domain packages:
   - `internal/config/constants.go` - ConfigFileName and timeout defaults
   - `internal/lock/constants.go` - LockFileName and LockFileVersion
   - `internal/managers/constants.go` - SupportedManagers and DefaultManager

2. **Updated imports** in 7 files:
   - commands/install.go - removed constants, already had managers
   - commands/uninstall.go - removed constants, added managers
   - commands/doctor.go - removed constants, already had managers
   - config/compat.go - replaced constants with managers
   - lock/yaml_lock.go - removed constants import
   - lock/yaml_lock_test.go - removed constants import
   - managers/registry.go - removed constants import

3. **Updated constant references**:
   - `constants.LockFileName` → `LockFileName` (in lock package)
   - `constants.LockFileVersion` → `LockFileVersion` (in lock package)
   - `constants.SupportedManagers` → `managers.SupportedManagers`
   - `constants.DefaultManager` → `managers.DefaultManager`

4. **Deleted** the `internal/constants/` directory

## Key Benefits
- Constants now live with their domain logic
- No more central constants package to look through
- Clearer ownership of constants
- More idiomatic Go structure

## Validation Results
- ✅ Build successful: `go build ./...`
- ✅ Unit tests passed: `just test`
- ✅ UX integration tests passed: `just test-ux`

## Package Count
- Before: 20 packages (after types deletion)
- After: 19 packages
- Progress: 3 packages eliminated total
