# Service Layer Simplification Complete

## Summary of Changes

### Phase 1: Simplified dotfile_operations.go ✅
1. **Moved ProcessDotfileForApply to core package** (~70 lines)
   - This was core business logic, not orchestration
   - Now lives in `internal/core/dotfiles.go` as it should

2. **Removed unused Add* functions** (~120 lines)
   - `AddSingleDotfile`
   - `AddSingleFile`
   - `AddDirectoryFiles`
   - These were duplicates of functions already in core package

3. **Cleaned up imports**
   - Removed unused imports after function removal

### Phase 2: Simplified package_operations.go ✅
1. **Removed unused CreatePackageProvider** (~7 lines)
   - This factory function was not used anywhere
   - The actual implementation is in runtime/context.go

2. **Kept ApplyPackages as-is**
   - This is true orchestration logic that belongs in services
   - It coordinates reconciliation, groups by manager, handles installations

### Results

**Lines of code removed**: ~197 lines
- ProcessDotfileForApply moved to core: ~70 lines
- Unused Add* functions removed: ~120 lines
- CreatePackageProvider removed: ~7 lines

**Service layer now contains only**:
1. `ApplyDotfiles` - Orchestrates applying all configured dotfiles
2. `ApplyPackages` - Orchestrates package installation across managers
3. Supporting types and adapters

**Benefits achieved**:
- Clear separation of concerns: services = orchestration, core = business logic
- Eliminated duplicate code between services and core
- Reduced indirection and complexity
- All tests continue to pass
