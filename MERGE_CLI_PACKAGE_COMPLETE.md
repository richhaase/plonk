# Completion Report: Merge CLI Package into Commands

## Summary
Successfully merged the `internal/cli` package into `internal/commands` package, reducing package count by 1.

## What Was Done

1. **Moved CLI helpers** from `internal/cli/helpers.go` to existing `internal/commands/helpers.go`
   - Discovered naming conflict - there was already a helpers.go file
   - Appended CLI helper functions to the existing helpers.go file
   - Added necessary imports (strings, operations, cobra)

2. **Updated imports** in 7 files:
   - Removed `"github.com/richhaase/plonk/internal/cli"` import
   - Changed function calls from `cli.FunctionName` to just `FunctionName`
   - Files updated: shared.go, ls.go, uninstall.go, rm.go, install.go, add.go, dotfiles.go

3. **Deleted** the now-empty `internal/cli/` directory

## Functions Merged
- `GetMetadataString()` - extracts metadata from operation results
- `SimpleFlags` struct - represents command flags
- `ParseSimpleFlags()` - parses manager and common flags
- `CompleteDotfilePaths()` - provides shell completion for dotfiles

## Validation Results
- ✅ Build successful: `go build ./...`
- ✅ Unit tests passed: `just test`
- ✅ UX integration tests passed: `just test-ux`

## Lessons Learned
- Always check for existing files before copying/moving to avoid overwriting
- The commands package already had a helpers.go file with OS-specific helper functions
- Git restore was useful for recovering from the accidental overwrite

## Package Count
- Before: 22 packages
- After: 21 packages
- Progress: 1 package eliminated
